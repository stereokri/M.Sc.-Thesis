Notes: As of March 22, 2023. 
The FDIC deposit insurance is backed by the full faith and 
credit of the United States through a line of credit with the 
U.S. Treasury. While the DIF was funded to its statutory 
limit before the last financial crisis, bank failures rapidly 
depleted it during the crisis. The DIF balance was at its 
lowest at the end of 2009 with a negative balance of $20.9 
billion. Through regular bank assessments the FDIC has 
increased the DIF to $128.2 billion as of December 2022. 
The fund has remained largely self-financed with some 
borrowings from the Treasury. As of year-end 2022, the 
FDIC insured deposits of nearly $10 trillion at 4,715 banks. 
Total deposits at the end of 2022 were over $19 trillion—
with FDIC insuring nearly 50% of all deposits. 
Overview of the Resolution Process 
As receiver of a failed bank, the FDIC evaluates all possible 
resolution alternatives and selects the one that is least costly 
to the DIF, per statute, unless the systemic risk exception 
(described below) is invoked. Typically, uninsured 
depositors, creditors, and shareholders are not protected 
against losses in order to meet the least cost requirement. 
The FDIC normally uses two main resolution methods: (1) 
purchase and assumption transactions and (2) deposit 
payoffs. Another method, bridge banks, is a type of 
resolution method the FDIC has used on a limited basis to 
resolve large or complex failing banks. 
Purchase and Assumption Agreement (P&A). The most 
commonly used resolution method is the P&A with an 
acquirer. The FDIC seeks bids from qualified bidders for</doc_content>

Bank Failures and the FDIC
This In Focus provides an introduction to the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC’s) process for 
resolving failing FDIC-insured banks. It also identifies 
policy issues Congress may consider related to the recent 
failures of two large banks in 2023—Silicon Valley Bank 
(SVB) and Signature Bank (SB).  
Overview of Bank Failures  
Banks fail for many reasons, although most trace back to 
the management of bank resources, resulting in a bank’s 
inability to meet liquidity or capital requirements. Liquidity 
is the ability of a bank to meet cash flow needs, including 
deposit withdrawals by its customers. Capital (equity) is the 
difference between assets and liabilities. A bank’s capital 
helps absorb losses on loans, securities purchased by the 
bank, and other assets while the bank remains solvent. 
When a bank’s capital situation deteriorates such that it 
fails to meet minimum regulatory standards, the bank’s 
primary federal regulator is required to take prompt 
corrective action (PCA). Regulators typically issue a PCA 
letter advising the bank on specific actions it must take to 
restore itself to financial health. When a critically 
undercapitalized bank fails to meet PCA requirements, its 
chartering agency will typically close the bank. By law, the 
FDIC is appointed receiver. 
Bank Failures, 2001-2020. There were 561 bank failures 
between 2001 and 2020 (see Table 1). The failed banks 
collectively held $721 billion in assets and $522 billion in 
deposits. In nominal dollars, the largest bank failure in U.S. 
history was Washington Mutual Bank in 2008 with $307 
billion in assets and $188 billion in deposits. Most 
depository institutions that failed were relatively small 
banks, with a large majority having less than $1 billion in 
deposits. Not all banks fail after becoming distressed—the 
number of problem banks identified by the bank regulators</doc_content>

<doc_content>brief period to move their deposits to other banks. The bank 
has no capitalization requirements. The FDIC retains all of 
the assets in its capacity as the receiver to eventually sell 
them. 
Loss Sharing Agreements. While the FDIC can enter into 
loss sharing agreements whenever it sells the assets of a 
failed bank to minimize the cost to the DIF, it has often 
been used with P&A transactions. Based on the P&A, the 
AI may purchase a majority, if not all, of the assets and 
assume all or some of the deposits and certain other 
liabilities of the failed bank or from a bridge bank. With 
loss sharing agreements, the FDIC agrees to absorb a 
portion of the losses on the sale or the write-downs on the 
value of loans. 
Recent Failures and Policy Issues 
The California Department of Financial Protection and 
Innovation closed SVB on the morning of Friday, March 
10. The New York State Department of Financial Services 
closed SB on Sunday, March 12. Typically, banks are 
closed on Friday evenings. During the last financial crisis, 
most of the failed banks were purchased by an AI; neither 
SVB nor SB initially had AIs.  
Arguably, the banking regulators did not anticipate the 
speed at which the conditions at these banks would 
deteriorate or the potential systemic issues. When SVB was 
closed, the FDIC initially created the Deposit Insurance 
National Bank of Santa Clara. It would have paid each 
depositor that qualified up to the insured limit of $250,000. 
Initially, the uninsured depositors would have been issued 
receivership certificates for the remaining balance of their 
deposits. Eventually, the uninsured depositors would have 
received dividends in different tranches as compensation 
when the FDIC sold the bank’s assets. Subsequently, the 
FDIC transferred all deposits and substantially all assets of 
the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara to 
Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A. Likewise, the FDIC 
created a bridge bank for SB, transferring all deposits and</doc_content>

<doc_content>banks, with a large majority having less than $1 billion in 
deposits. Not all banks fail after becoming distressed—the 
number of problem banks identified by the bank regulators 
reached a high of 884, representing $390 billion in assets at 
the end of 2010.  
In response to the bank failures between 2007 and 2010 and 
the related financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and 
Consumer Protection Act in 2010 (P.L. 111-203) was 
enacted to reform the financial regulatory system. The act 
permanently increased the deposit insurance limit from 
$100,000 to $250,000. Subsequently, in 2018, the 
Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer 
Protection Act (P.L. 115-174) was enacted, providing banks 
regulatory relief from certain requirements.  
Bank Failures, 2021-2023. There were no bank failures in 
2021 or 2022. The two bank failures in 2023—SVB and 
SB—collectively held $319 billion in assets and $264 
billion in deposits (see Table 1). The second-largest bank 
failure in U.S. history was SVB, with $209 billion in assets 
and $175 billion in deposits. SB had $110 billion in assets 
and $89 billion in deposits when it failed. The number of 
problem banks as of Q3 2022 was 39, with combined assets 
of $47.5 billion.  
Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). Deposit insurance 
guarantees repayments of deposits at a bank up to the 
statutory insured limit, $250,000. It is intended to protect 
depositors, prevent bank runs, and reduce the risk of 
systemic failure of the banking system. Banks pay deposit 
insurance premiums to the FDIC, which maintains the DIF 
to meet its obligations of insuring deposits and resolving 
failed banks. Since the start of federal deposit insurance in 
1934, all depositors have been made whole up to their 
insured limits after bank failures.

According to the text, the two main resolution methods that the FDIC normally uses for failing banks are:

1. Purchase and Assumption Agreement (P&A) transactions
2. Deposit payoffs
