<doc_content>evaluated for impairment regularly, amortization of the cost of acquired intangibles is an expense that is not 
typically affected by operations during any particular period. 
Employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions. Datadog excludes employer payroll tax expense on 
equity incentive plans as these expenses are tied to the exercise or vesting of underlying equity awards and 
the price of Datadog’s common stock at the time of vesting or exercise. As a result, these taxes may vary in 
any particular period independent of the financial and operating performance of Datadog’s business.
Amortization of issuance costs. In June 2020, Datadog issued $747.5 million of convertible senior notes due 
2025, which bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 0.125%. Debt issuance costs, which reduce the carrying 
value of the convertible debt instrument, are amortized as interest expense over the term. The expense for the 
amortization of debt issuance costs is a non-cash item, and we believe the exclusion of this interest expense 
will provide for a more useful comparison of our operational performance in different periods.</doc_content>
