<doc_content>capitalized software development costs, if any. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these 
historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others in assessing 
Datadog’s operating performance due to the following factors:
Stock-based compensation. Datadog utilizes stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees. It is 
principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of its stockholders and at long-term retention, rather than 
to address operational performance for any particular period. As a result, stock-based compensation expenses 
vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in any particular period.
Amortization of acquired intangibles. Datadog views amortization of acquired intangible assets as items arising 
from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are 
evaluated for impairment regularly, amortization of the cost of acquired intangibles is an expense that is not 
typically affected by operations during any particular period. 
Employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions. Datadog excludes employer payroll tax expense on 
equity incentive plans as these expenses are tied to the exercise or vesting of underlying equity awards and 
the price of Datadog’s common stock at the time of vesting or exercise. As a result, these taxes may vary in 
any particular period independent of the financial and operating performance of Datadog’s business.
Amortization of issuance costs. In June 2020, Datadog issued $747.5 million of convertible senior notes due 
2025, which bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 0.125%. Debt issuance costs, which reduce the carrying 
value of the convertible debt instrument, are amortized as interest expense over the term. The expense for the 
amortization of debt issuance costs is a non-cash item, and we believe the exclusion of this interest expense 
will provide for a more useful comparison of our operational performance in different periods.
Additionally, Datadog’s management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure free cash flow is 
meaningful to investors because it is a measure of liquidity that provides useful information in understanding 
and evaluating the strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic 
opportunities or investing in our business. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, 
reduced by capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs, if any. The reduction of capital 
expenditures and amounts capitalized for software development facilitates comparisons of Datadog's liquidity 
on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that management does not consider to be indicative of our 
liquidity.
Operating Metrics
Datadog’s number of customers with ARR of $100,000 or more is based on the ARR of each customer, as of 
the last month of the quarter. </doc_content>

According to the context provided, there is no mention of capitalized software development costs in the condensed consolidated statements of operations or any other table. Therefore, it can be concluded that Datadog did not report any capitalized software development costs for the three months that ended September 30, 2023.




DEEPSEEK OUTPUT:


Okay, so I need to figure out how much capitalized software development costs (SDCs) Datadog reported for the three months ending September 30, 2023. Let me start by understanding what SDCs are and where they might be reported in the financial statements.

From the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations provided, I can see that there are several footnotes and details about different expenses, including R&D, sales and marketing, general and administrative, etc. SDCs would typically fall under R&D expenses because software development is a part of product development.

Looking at the table, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, the total operating expenses are broken down into R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative. The R&D line item includes stock-based compensation expense but doesn't explicitly mention SDCs. However, in footnotes (1), (2), and (3), there are details about different types of expenses.

Footnote (1) mentions that cost of revenue includes SBC (stock-based compensation) as well as other costs like R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative. Similarly, R&D includes SBC and possibly other costs related to software development.

Wait, but the user is asking specifically about capitalized software development costs. Capitalized costs are typically expensed over multiple periods through amortization rather than being expensed immediately as an operating expense. So, I need to check if these costs are reported separately or included in R&D expenses.

Looking back at the financial statements, under "Cost of revenue" and other operating expenses, there's no separate line item for capitalized SDCs. However, in footnotes (1), (2), and (3), they mention different types of non-cash charges like stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, and employer payroll taxes.

Footnote (4) talks about amortization of issuance costs related to debt, not software development. So, SDCs would likely be part of R&D expenses but might be capitalized and amortized over a period.

Wait, the user is asking for how much was reported in the financial statements, so perhaps it's included in R&D expenses as a capitalized cost that's being amortized. But since the financial statements don't explicitly list SDCs separately, I need to infer from the footnotes or other sections.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that Datadog doesn't separately report SDCs but includes them within R&D expenses. However, the user might be expecting a specific figure, so perhaps I should look for any mention of capitalized software costs in the footnotes.

Looking again at the footnotes, there's no explicit mention of SDCs being capitalized and amortized. So, it's possible that Datadog doesn't separately report them or that they are included within R&D expenses as part of the cost structure without capitalization.

Wait, but the user is specifically asking about capitalized costs, which would be reported as a separate line item if material. Since I don't see such a line item in the provided financials, it's likely that Datadog doesn't have significant capitalized SDCs or they are not required to report them separately.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that the information isn't provided in the given documents, so I can't determine the exact amount from this data. But since the user is asking for a specific figure, maybe I should look again at the R&D expenses and see if any part of them relates to capitalized software development.

In the three months ended September 30, 2023, R&D expenses are $240,225. This includes SBC but not necessarily SDCs unless they're capitalized. If SDCs were capitalized, they would be amortized over the useful life of the software, which is typically 5-10 years.

Given that the financial statements don't provide a separate line item for SDCs, it's possible that Datadog doesn't report them separately or that they are not material to their financials. Therefore, the answer might be that there isn't enough information provided to determine the exact amount of capitalized software development costs for that period.

Alternatively, if I have to make an educated guess based on typical reporting practices, SDCs would likely be included within R&D expenses as part of the cost of goods sold or operating expenses. Since they are capitalized, their expense is recognized over multiple periods through amortization, but the initial cost isn't explicitly stated unless there's a line item for it.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Datadog doesn't separately report capitalized software development costs. Therefore, I can't provide an exact figure from the given data.
</think>

Based on the analysis of the provided financial statements and footnotes, Datadog does not separately report capitalized software development costs (SDCs). The expenses related to R&D include stock-based compensation but do not explicitly list SDCs as a separate line item. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact amount of capitalized SDCs from the given data.
