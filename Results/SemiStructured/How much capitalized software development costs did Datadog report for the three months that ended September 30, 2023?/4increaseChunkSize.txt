<doc_content>capitalized software development costs, if any. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these 
historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others in assessing 
Datadog’s operating performance due to the following factors:
Stock-based compensation. Datadog utilizes stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees. It is 
principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of its stockholders and at long-term retention, rather than 
to address operational performance for any particular period. As a result, stock-based compensation expenses 
vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in any particular period.
Amortization of acquired intangibles. Datadog views amortization of acquired intangible assets as items arising 
from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are 
evaluated for impairment regularly, amortization of the cost of acquired intangibles is an expense that is not 
typically affected by operations during any particular period. 
Employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions. Datadog excludes employer payroll tax expense on 
equity incentive plans as these expenses are tied to the exercise or vesting of underlying equity awards and 
the price of Datadog’s common stock at the time of vesting or exercise. As a result, these taxes may vary in 
any particular period independent of the financial and operating performance of Datadog’s business.
Amortization of issuance costs. In June 2020, Datadog issued $747.5 million of convertible senior notes due 
2025, which bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 0.125%. Debt issuance costs, which reduce the carrying 
value of the convertible debt instrument, are amortized as interest expense over the term. The expense for the 
amortization of debt issuance costs is a non-cash item, and we believe the exclusion of this interest expense 
will provide for a more useful comparison of our operational performance in different periods.
Additionally, Datadog’s management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure free cash flow is 
meaningful to investors because it is a measure of liquidity that provides useful information in understanding 
and evaluating the strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic 
opportunities or investing in our business. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, 
reduced by capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs, if any. The reduction of capital 
expenditures and amounts capitalized for software development facilitates comparisons of Datadog's liquidity</doc_content>

expenditures and amounts capitalized for software development facilitates comparisons of Datadog's liquidity 
on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that management does not consider to be indicative of our
