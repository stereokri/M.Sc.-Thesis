=== Question 1 ===
When George and Lennie approach the river, why does George warn Lennie not to drink too much water?

--- Chunk 1 ---
so the water arose in little splashes; rings widened across the pool 
to the other side and came back again. Lennie watched them go. 
"Look, George. Look what I done." 
 
 George knelt beside the pool and drank from his hand with quick 
scoops. "Tastes all right," he admitted. "Don’t really seem to be 
running, though. You never oughta drink water when it ain’t 
running, Lennie," he said hopelessly. "You’d drink out of a gutter

Lennie said, "I like beans with ketchup." 
 
 "Well, we ain’t got no ketchup. You go get wood. An’ don’t you fool 
around. It’ll be dark before long." 
 
 Lennie lumbered to his feet and disappeared in the brush. George 
lay where he was and whistled softly to himself. There were 
sounds of splashings down the river in the direction Lennie had 
taken. George stopped whistling and listened, "Poor bastard," he 
said softly, and then went on whistling again.

running, Lennie," he said hopelessly. "You’d drink out of a gutter 
if you was thirsty." He threw a scoop of water into his face and 
rubbed it about with his hand, under his chin and around the back 
of his neck. Then he replaced his hat, pushed himself back from 
the river, drew up his knees and embraced them. Lennie, who had 
been watching, imitated George exactly. He pushed himself back, 
drew up his knees, embraced them, looked over to George to see

--- Chunk 7 ---
up on the bank and his hat dripped down on his blue coat and ran 
down his back. "Tha’s good," he said. "You drink some, George. 
You take a good big drink." He smiled happily. 
 
 George unslung his bindle and dropped it gently on the bank. "I 
ain’t sure it’s good water," he said. "Looks kinda scummy." 
 
 Lennie dabb1ed his big paw in the water and wiggled his fingers

--- Chunk 8 ---
George took off his hat. He said shakily, "Take off your hat, 
Lennie. The air feels fine." 
 
 Lennie removed his hat dutifully and laid it on the ground in 
front of him. The shadow in the val-ley was bluer, and the evening 
came fast. On the wind the sound of crashing in the brush came to 
them. 
 
 Lennie said, "Tell how it's gonna be." 
 
 George had been listening to the distant sounds. For a moment he 
was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so

--- Chunk 9 ---
"I wasn’t doin’ nothing bad with it, George. Jus’ strokin’ it." 
 
 George stood up and threw the mouse as far as he could into the 
darkening brush, and then he stepped to the pool and washed his 
hands. "You crazy fool. Don’t you think I could see your feet was 
wet where you went acrost the river to get it?" He heard Lennie’s 
whimpering cry and wheeled about. "Blubberin’ like a baby! Jesus 
Christ! A big guy like you." Lennie’s lip quivered and tears started

river, "George, you want I should go away and leave you alone?" 
 
 "Where the hell could you go?" 
 
 "Well, I could. I could go off in the hills there. Some place I’d find 
a cave." 
 
 "Yeah' How’d you eat. You ain’t got sense enough to find nothing 
to eat." 
 
 "I’d find things, George. I don’t need no nice food with ketchup. I’d 
lay out in the sun and nohody’d hurt me; An’ if I foun’ a mouse, I 
could keep it. Nobody’d take it away from me."


=== Question 2 ===
What has George told Lennie about that he always remembers even when he forgets everything else?

--- Chunk 1 ---
did, George." 
 
 "O.K.- O.K. I’ll tell ya again. I ain’t got nothing to do. Might jus’ 
as well spen’ all my time tellin’ you things and then you forget 
’em, and I tell you again." 
 
 "Tried and tried," said Lennie, "but it didn’t do no good. I 
remember about the rabbits, George." 
 
 "The hell with the rabbits. That’s all you ever can remember is 
them rabbits. O.K.! Now you listen and this time you got to 
remember so we don’t get in no trouble. You remember settin’ in

--- Chunk 4 ---
"Yeah, what ya want?" 
 
 "Where we goin’, George?" 
 
 The little man jerked down the brim of his hat and scowled over 
at Lennie. "So yon forgot that awready, did you? I gotta tell you 
again, do I? Jesus Christ, you’re a crazy bastard!" 
 
 "I forgot," Lennie said softly. "I tried not to forget. Honest to God I

--- Chunk 5 ---
"Yeah, what ya want?" 
 
 "Where we goin’, George?" 
 
 The little man jerked down the brim of his hat and scowled over 
at Lennie. "So yon forgot that awready, did you? I gotta tell you 
again, do I? Jesus Christ, you’re a crazy bastard!" 
 
 "I forgot," Lennie said softly. "I tried not to forget. Honest to God I

--- Chunk 6 ---
Lennie choked with pride. "I can remember," he said. 
 
 George motioned with his spoon again. "Look, Lennie. I want you 
to look around here. You can remember this place, can’t you? The 
ranch is about a quarter mile up that way. Just follow the river?" 
 
 "Sure," said Lennie. "I can remember this. Di’n’t I remember 
about not gonna say a word?" 
 
 "’Course you did. Well, look Lennie - if you jus’ happen to get in 
trouble like you always done be fore, I want you to come right here

--- Chunk 7 ---
When the sound of his footsteps had died away George turned on 
Lennie. "So you wasn’t gonna say a word. You was gonna leave 
your big flapper shut and leave me do the talkin’. Damn near lost 
us the job." 
 
 Lennie stared hopelessly at his hands. "I forgot George." 
 
 "Yeah, you forgot. You always forget, an’ I got to talk you out of 
it." He sat down heavily on. the bunk. "Now he’s got his eye on us. 
Now we got to be careful and not make no slips. You keep your big

--- Chunk 8 ---
remember so we don’t get in no trouble. You remember settin’ in 
that gutter on Howard Street and watchin’ that blackboard?" 
 
 Lennie’s face broke into a delighted smile. "Why sure, George. I 
remember that.... but.... what’d we do then? I remember some girls 
come by and you says.... you say." 
 
 "The hell with what I says. You remember about us goin’ into 
Murray and Ready’s, and they give us work cards and bus 
tickets?" 
 
 "Oh, sure, George. I remember that now." His hands went quickly

--- Chunk 9 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 10 ---
every damn month. Get a gallon of whisky, or set in a pool room 
and play cards or shoot pool." Lennie knelt and looked over the 
fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s face was drawn with terror. 
"An’ whatta I got," George went on furiously. "I got you! You can’t 
keep a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me shovin’ all 
over the country all the time. An’ that ain’t the,' worst. You get in 
trouble. You do bad things and I got m get you out." His voice rose


=== Question 3 ===
Why does Lennie have a dead mouse in his pocket?

--- Chunk 1 ---
"Give ithere!" 
 
 Lennie’s closed hand slowly obeyed. George took the mouse and 
threw it across the pool to the other side, among the brush. "What 
you want of a dead mouse, anyways?" 
 
 "I could pet it with my thumb while we walked along," said 
Lennie. 
 
 "Well, you ain’t petting no mice while you walk with me. You 
remember where we’re goin’ now?" 
 
 Lennie looked startled and then in embarrassment hid his face 
against his knees. "I forgot again."

--- Chunk 4 ---
puttin’ nothing over." 
 
 Lennie hesitated, backed away, looked wildly at the brush line as 
though he contemplated running for his freedom. George said 
coldly, "You gonna give me that mouse or do I have to sock you?" 
 
 "Give you what, George?" 
 
 "You know God damn well what. I want that mouse." 
 
 Lennie reluctantly reached into his pocket. His voice broke a 
little. "I don’t know why I can’t keep it. It ain’t nobody’s mouse. I 
didn’t steal it. I found it lyin’ right beside the road."

--- Chunk 6 ---
Christ! A big guy like you." Lennie’s lip quivered and tears started 
in his eyes. "Aw, Lennie!" George put his hand on Lennie’s 
shoulder. "I ain’t takin’ it away jus’ for ' meanness. That mouse 
ain’t fresh, Lennie; and besides, you’ve broke it pettin’ it. You get 
another mouse that’s fresh and I’ll let you keep it a little while." 
 
 Lennie sat down on the ground and hung his head dejectedly, "I 
don’t know where there is no other mouse. I remember a lady used

--- Chunk 7 ---
hand - hidin’ it?" 
 
 "I ain’t got nothin’, George, Honest." 
 
 "Come on, give it here." 
 
 Lennie held his closed hand away from George's direction. "It’s 
only a mouse, George." 
 
 "A mouse? A live mouse?" 
 
 "Uh-uh. Jus’ a dead mouse, George. I didn’ kill it. ’ Honest! I 
found it. I found it dead." 
 
 "Give it here!" said George. 
 
 "Aw, leave me have it, George." 
 
 "Give ithere!" 
 
 Lennie’s closed hand slowly obeyed. George took the mouse and

--- Chunk 8 ---
don’t know where there is no other mouse. I remember a lady used 
to give ’em to me - ever’ one she got. But that lady ain’t here." 
 
 George scoffed. "Lady, huh? Don’t even remember who that lady 
was. That was your own Aunt Clara. An’ she stopped givin’ ’em to 
ya. You always killed ’em." 
 
 Lennie looked sadly up at him. "They was so little," he said, 
apologetically. "I’d pet ’em, and pretty soon they bit my fingers 
and I pinched their heads a little and then they was dead -

--- Chunk 9 ---
could keep it. Nobody’d take it away from me." 
 
 George looked quickly and searchingly at him. "I been mean, ain’t 
I?" 
 
 "If you don’ want me I can go off in the hills an’ find a cave. I can 
go away any time." 
 
 "No - look! I was jus’ foolin’, Lennie. ’Cause'. I want you to stay 
with me. Trouble with mice is you always kill ’em." He paused. 
"Tell you what I’ll do, Lennie. First chance I get I'll give you a pup. 
Maybe you wouldn’t killit. That’d be better than. mice. And you

pocket." His hand went into the pocket again. 
 
 George looked sharply at him. "What’d you take outa that 
pocket?" 
 
 "Ain’t a thing in my pocket," Lennie said cleverly. 
 
 "I know there ain’t. You got it in your hand. What you got in your


=== Question 4 ===
Why does George order Lennie not to talk when they get to the ranch?

--- Chunk 1 ---
"Tell you what?" 
 
 "About the rabbits." 
 
 George snapped, "You ain’t gonna put nothing over on me." 
 
 Lennie pleads "Come on, George. Tell me. Please, George. Like 
you done before." 
 
 "You get a kick outta that, don’t you? Awright, I’ll tell you, and 
then we’ll eat our supper...." 
 
 George’s voice became deeper. He repeated his words 
rhythmically as though he had said them many times before. 
"Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the

--- Chunk 2 ---
"Tell you what?" 
 
 "About the rabbits." 
 
 George snapped, "You ain’t gonna put nothing over on me."

 "You get a kick outta that, don’t you? Awright, I’ll tell you, and

to look around here. You can remember this place, can’t you? The

 "Sure," said Lennie. "I can remember this. Di’n’t I remember

 "’Course you did. Well, look Lennie - if you jus’ happen to get in

--- Chunk 6 ---
"Yeah. Did she come in the barn?" 
 
 "No. Anyways I never seen her." 
 
 "You never seen Slim talkin' to her?" 
 
 "Uh-uh. She ain't been in the barn." 
 
 "O.K.," said George. "I guess them guys ain't gonna see no fight. If 
there's any fightin', Lennie, you keep out of it." 
 
 "I don't want no fights," said Lennie. He got up from his bunk and

--- Chunk 7 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

--- Chunk 8 ---
Don't never speak to him. If he comes in here you move clear to 
the other side of the room. Will you do that, Lennie?" 
 
 "I don't want no trouble," Lennie mourned. "I never done nothing 
to him." 
 
 "Well, that won't do you no good if Curley wants to plug himself 
up for a fighter. Just don't have nothing to do with him. Will you 
remember?" 
 
 "Sure, George. I ain't gonna say a word." 
 
 The sound of the approaching grain teams was louder, thud of big

--- Chunk 9 ---
Lennie giggled happily. "I didn’t forget that, you bet." 
 
 George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his 
head, and Lennie imitated him, raising his head to see whether he 
were doing it right. "God, you’re a lot of trouble," said George. "I 
could get along so easy and so nice if I didn’t have you on my tail. I 
could live so easy and maybe have a girl." 
 
 For a moment Lennie lay quiet, and then he said hopefully, "We 
gonna work on a ranch, George."

--- Chunk 10 ---
his arm in a sling-an' if Curley gets tough, you can break his other 
han'. You didn't put nothing over on me about gettin' it caught in 
no machine." 
 
 But Lennie was not to be drawn. "No, sir. I ain't gonna talk to you 
or nothing." 
 
 She knelt in the hay beside him. "Listen," she said "All the guys 
got a horseshoe tenement goin' on. It' on'y about four o'clock. None 
of them guys is goin to leave that tenement. Why can't I talk to


=== Question 5 ===
What happened to all of the mice that Lennie's Aunt Clara gave him?

--- Chunk 1 ---
don’t know where there is no other mouse. I remember a lady used 
to give ’em to me - ever’ one she got. But that lady ain’t here." 
 
 George scoffed. "Lady, huh? Don’t even remember who that lady

 George looked quickly and searchingly at him. "I been mean, ain’t 
I?" 
 
 "If you don’ want me I can go off in the hills an’ find a cave. I can 
go away any time." 
 
 "No - look! I was jus’ foolin’, Lennie. ’Cause'. I want you to stay 
with me. Trouble with mice is you always kill ’em." He paused. 
"Tell you what I’ll do, Lennie. First chance I get I'll give you a pup.

--- Chunk 6 ---
said softly, and then went on whistling again. 
 
 In a moment Lennie came crashing back through the brush. He 
carried one small willow stick in his hand. George sat up. 
"Awright," he said brusquely. "Gi’me that mouse!" 
 
 But Lennie made an elaborate pantomime of innocence. "What 
mouse, George? I ain’t got no mouse." 
 
 George held out his hand. "Come on. Give it to me. You ain’t 
puttin’ nothing over." 
 
 Lennie hesitated, backed away, looked wildly at the brush line as

--- Chunk 7 ---
Christ! A big guy like you." Lennie’s lip quivered and tears started 
in his eyes. "Aw, Lennie!" George put his hand on Lennie’s 
shoulder. "I ain’t takin’ it away jus’ for ' meanness. That mouse 
ain’t fresh, Lennie; and besides, you’ve broke it pettin’ it. You get

and I pinched their heads a little and then they was dead - 
because they was so little. 
 
 "I wish’t we’d get the rabbits pretty soon, George. They ain’t so 
little." 
 
 "The hell with the rabbits. An’ you ain’t to be trusted with no live 
mice; Your Aunt Clara give you a rubber mouse and you wouldn’t 
have nothing to do with it." 
 
 "It wasn’t no good to pet," said Lennie. 
 
 The flame of the sunset lifted from the mountain-tops and dusk

puttin’ nothing over." 
 
 Lennie hesitated, backed away, looked wildly at the brush line as

Why have George and Lennie run away from Weed?

Luger," and he ran out too. 
 
 Slim turned quietly to George. "I guess Lennie done it, all right," 
he said. "Her neck's bust. Lennie coulda did that." 
 
 George didn't answer, but he nodded slowly. His hat was so far 
down on his forehead that his eyes were covered. 
 
 Slim went on, "Maybe like that time in Weed you was tellin' 
about." 
 
 Again George nodded.

 "O.K.," said George. "An’ you ain’t gonna do no bad things like you 
done in Weed, neither." 
 
 Lennie looked puzzled. "Like I done in Weed?" 
 
 "Oh, so ya forgot that too, did ya. Well, I ain’t gonna remind ya, 
fear ya do it again." 
 
 A light of understanding broke on Lennie’s face. "They run us 
outa Weed," he exploded triumphantly. 
 
 "Run us out, hell," said George disgustedly. "We run. They was

fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s face was drawn with terror. 
"An’ whatta I got," George went on furiously. "I got you! You can’t 
keep a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me shovin’ all 
over the country all the time. An’ that ain’t the,' worst. You get in 
trouble. You do bad things and I got m get you out." His voice rose

brush. 
 
 "I won’t get in no trouble, George. I ain’t gonna say a word." 
 
 "O.K. Bring your bindle over here by the fire. It’s gonna be nice 
sleepin’ here. Lookin’ up, and the leaves. Don’t build up no more 
fire. We’ll let her die down." 
 
 They made their beds on the sand, and as the blaze dropped from 
the fire the sphere of light grew smaller; the curling branches 
disappeared and only a faint glimmer showed where the tree 
trunks were. From the darkness Lennie called, "George - you

said. "A guy can go in an' get drunk and get ever'thing outa his 
system all at once, an' no messes. And he knows how much it's 
gonna set him back. These here jail baits is just set on the trigger 
of the hoosegow." 
 
 Lennie followed his words admiringly, and moved his lips a little 
to keep up. George continued, "You remember Andy Cushman, 
Lennie? Went to grammar school?" 
 
 "The one that his old lady used to make hot cakes for the kids?" 
Lennie asked.

--- Chunk 8 ---
paused. 
 
 His voice grew soft and persuasive. "S'pose George don't come 
back no more. S'pose he took a powder and just ain't coming back. 
What'll you do then?" 
 
 Lennie's attention came gradually to what had been said. "What?" 
he demanded. 
 
 "I said s'pose George went into town tonight and you never heard 
of him no more." Crooks pressed forward some kind of private 
victory. "Just s'pose that," he repeated. 
 
 "He won't do it," Lennie cried. "George wouldn't do nothing like

"Run us out, hell," said George disgustedly. "We run. They was 
lookin’ for us, but they didn’t catch us.

--- Chunk 10 ---
"I never meant no harm, George. Honest I never." 
 
 "Well, you keep away from her, 'cause she's a rattrap if I ever 
seen one. You let Curley take the rap. He let himself in for it. 
Glove fulla vaseline," George said disgustedly. "An' I bet he's eatin' 
raw eggs and writin' to the patent medicine houses." 
 
 Lennie cried out suddenly-"I don' like this place, George. This 
ain't no good place. I wanna get outa here." 
 
 "We gotta keep it till we get a stake. We can't help it, Lennie.

What does Lennie want to eat with his beans?

and set around it an’ listen to the rain comin’ down on the roof - 
Nuts!" He took out his pocket knife. "I ain’t got time for no more." 
He drove his knife through the top of one of the bean cans, sawed 
out the top and passed the can to Lennie. Then he opened a second 
can. From his side pocket he brought out two spoons and passed 
one of them to Lennie. 
 
 They sat by the fire and filled their mouths with beans and 
chewed mightily. A few beans slipped out of the side of Lennie’s

mouth. George gestured with his spoon. "What you gonna say 
tomorrow when the boss asks you questions?" 
 
 Lennie stopped chewing and swallowed. His face was 
concentrated. "I.... I ain’t gonna.... say a word." 
 
 "Good boy! That’s fine, Lennie! Maybe you’re gettin’ better. When 
we get the coupla acres I can let you tend the rabbits all right.

’Specially if you remember as good as that."

--- Chunk 6 ---
fell to work. George undid his bindle and brought out three cans of 
beans. He stood them about the fire, close in against the blaze, but 
not quite touching the flame. 
 
 "There’s enough beans for four men," George said. 
 
 Lennie watched him from over the fire. He said patiently, "I like 
’em with ketchup." 
 
 "Well, we ain’t got any," George exploded. "Whatever we ain’t got, 
that’s what you want. God a’mighty, if I was alone I could live so

--- Chunk 7 ---
cow or a goat, and the cream is so God damn thick you got to cut it 
with a knife and take it out with a spoon." 
 
 Lennie watched him with wide eyes, and old Candy watched him 
too. Lennie said softly, "We could live offa the fatta the lan'." 
 
 "Sure," said George. "All kin's a vegetables in the garden, and if 
we want a little whisky we can sell a few eggs or something, or 
some milk. We'd jus' live there. We'd belong there. There wouldn't

and have supper."

--- Chunk 9 ---
Tomorra we’re gonna go to work I seen thrashin’ machines on the 
way down. That means we’ll be bucking grain bags, bustin’ a gut. 
Tonight I’m gonna lay right here and look up. I like it." 
 
 Lennie got up on his knees and looked down at George. "Ain’t we 
gonna have no supper?" 
 
 "Sure we are, if you gather up some dead willow sticks, I got three 
cans of beans in my bindle. You get a fire ready. I’ll give you a 
match when you get the sticks together. Then we’ll heat the beans

--- Chunk 10 ---
her,' an' we would. Jus' milk the cow and sling some grain to the 
chickens an' go to her." 
 
 "An' put some grass to the rabbits," Lennie broke in. "I wouldn't 
never forget to feed them. When we gon'ta do it, George?" 
 
 "In one month. Right squack in one month. Know what I'm gon'ta 
do? I'm gon'ta write to them old people that owns the place that 
we'll take it. An' Candy'll send a hunderd dollars to bind her." 
 
 "Sure will," said Candy. "They got a good stove there?"


=== Question 8 ===
Why does George say that migrant workers who travel from farm to farm are the loneliest people in the world?

--- Chunk 1 ---
"Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the 
world. They got no family. They don’t belong no place. They come 
to a ranch an’ work up a stake and then they go inta town and 
blow their stake, and the first thing you know they’re poundin’ 
their tail on some other ranch. They ain’t got nothing to look 
ahead to." 
 
 Lennie was delighted. "That’s it - that’s it. Now tell how it is with 
us." 
 
 George went on. "With us it ain’t like that. We got a future. We

invitation to confidence. 
 
 "What's funny about it?" George demanded defensively. 
 
 "Oh, I dunno. Hardly none of the guys ever travel together. I 
hardly never seen two guys travel together. You know how the 
hands are, they just come in and get their bunk and work a 
month, and then they quit and go out alone. Never seem to give a 
damn about nobody. It jus' seems kinda funny a cuckoo like him 
and a smart little guy like you travelin' together."

--- Chunk 5 ---
"Tell you what?" 
 
 "About the rabbits." 
 
 George snapped, "You ain’t gonna put nothing over on me." 
 
 Lennie pleads "Come on, George. Tell me. Please, George. Like 
you done before." 
 
 "You get a kick outta that, don’t you? Awright, I’ll tell you, and 
then we’ll eat our supper...." 
 
 George’s voice became deeper. He repeated his words 
rhythmically as though he had said them many times before. 
"Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the

--- Chunk 6 ---
and a smart little guy like you travelin' together." 
 
 "He ain't no cuckoo," said George. "He's dumb as hell, but he ain't 
crazy. An' I ain't so bright neither, or I wouldn't be buckin' barley 
for my fifty and found. If I was bright, if I was even a little bit 
smart, I'd have my own little place, an' I'd be bringin' in my own 
crops, 'stead of doin' all the work and not getting what comes up 
outa the ground." George fell silent. He wanted to talk. Slim

--- Chunk 7 ---
Take a real smart guy and he ain't hardly ever a nice fella." 
 
 George stacked the scattered cards and began to lay out his 
solitaire hand. The shoes thudded on the ground outside. At the 
windows the light of the evening still made the window squares 
bright. 
 
 "I ain't got no people," George said. "I seen the guys that go 
around on the ranches alone. That ain't no good. They don't have

--- Chunk 8 ---
somebody -to be near him." He whined, "A guy goes nuts if he ain't 
got nobody. Don't make no difference who the guy is, long's he's 
with you. I tell ya," he cried, "I tell ya a guy gets too lonely an' he 
gets sick." 
 
 "George gonna come back," Lennie reassured himself in a 
frightened voice. "Maybe George come back already. Maybe I 
better go see." 
 
 Crooks said, "I didn't mean to scare you. He'll come back. I was

--- Chunk 9 ---
"George says we're gonna have alfalfa for the rabbits." 
 
 "What rabbits?" 
 
 "We're gonna have rabbits an' a berry patch." 
 
 "You're nuts." 
 
 "We are too. You ast George." 
 
 "You're nuts." Crooks was scornful. "I seen hunderds of men come 
by on the road an' on the ranches, with their bindles on their back 
an' that same damn thing in their heads. Hunderds of them. They 
come, an' they quit an' go on; an' every damn one of 'em's got a

river, "George, you want I should go away and leave you alone?" 
 
 "Where the hell could you go?" 
 
 "Well, I could. I could go off in the hills there. Some place I’d find 
a cave." 
 
 "Yeah' How’d you eat. You ain’t got sense enough to find nothing 
to eat." 
 
 "I’d find things, George. I don’t need no nice food with ketchup. I’d 
lay out in the sun and nohody’d hurt me; An’ if I foun’ a mouse, I 
could keep it. Nobody’d take it away from me."


=== Question 9 ===
What dream do George and Lennie share?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Lennie giggled happily. "I didn’t forget that, you bet." 
 
 George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his 
head, and Lennie imitated him, raising his head to see whether he 
were doing it right. "God, you’re a lot of trouble," said George. "I 
could get along so easy and so nice if I didn’t have you on my tail. I 
could live so easy and maybe have a girl." 
 
 For a moment Lennie lay quiet, and then he said hopefully, "We 
gonna work on a ranch, George."

"It ain't so funny, him an' me goin' aroun' together," George said 
at last. "Him and me was both born in Auburn. I knowed his Aunt 
Clara. She took him when he was a baby and raised him up. When 
his Aunt Clara died, Lennie just come along with me out workin'. 
Got kinda used to each other after a little while."

keep a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me shovin’ all

"O.K. Someday - we’re gonna get the jack together and we’re 
gonna have a little house and a couple of acres an’ a cow and some 
pigs and -" 
 
 "An’ live off the fatta the lan’,"Lennie shouted. "An’ haverabbits. 
Go on, George! Tell about what we’re gonna have in the garden 
and about the rabbits in the cages and about the rain in the 
winter and the stove, and how thick the cream is an the milk like 
you can hardly cut it. Tell about that, George."

--- Chunk 8 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

and four of diamonds on it. "Andy's in San Quentin right now on 
account of a tart," said George. 
 
 Lennie drummed on the table with his fingers. "George?" 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "George, how long's it gonna be till we get that little place an' live 
on the fatta the lan-an' rabbits?" 
 
 "I don' know," said George. "We gotta get a big stake together. I 
know a little place we can get cheap, but they ain't givin' it away."

--- Chunk 10 ---
I wasn't drunk. I don't know if I was asleep. If some guy was with 
me, he could tell me I was asleep, an' then it would be all right. 
But I jus' don't know." Crooks was looking across the room now, 
looking toward the window. 
 
 Lennie said miserably, "George won't go away and leave me. I 
know George wun't do that." 
 
 The stable buck went on dreamily, "I remember when I was a

That's jus' what you says to me." 
 
 George turned to Lennie. "It ain't your fault," he said. "You don't 
need to be scairt no more. You done jus' what I tol' you to. Maybe 
you better go in the ' wash room an' clean up your face. You look

 Lennie smiled with his bruised mouth. "I didn't want no trouble," 
he said. He walked toward the door, but just before he came to it, 
he turned back. "George?"

--- Chunk 7 ---
paused. 
 
 His voice grew soft and persuasive. "S'pose George don't come 
back no more. S'pose he took a powder and just ain't coming back. 
What'll you do then?" 
 
 Lennie's attention came gradually to what had been said. "What?"

 "I said s'pose George went into town tonight and you never heard

 "He won't do it," Lennie cried. "George wouldn't do nothing like

 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

When the sound of his footsteps had died away George turned on 
Lennie. "So you wasn’t gonna say a word. You was gonna leave 
your big flapper shut and leave me do the talkin’. Damn near lost 
us the job." 
 
 Lennie stared hopelessly at his hands. "I forgot George." 
 
 "Yeah, you forgot. You always forget, an’ I got to talk you out of 
it." He sat down heavily on. the bunk. "Now he’s got his eye on us. 
Now we got to be careful and not make no slips. You keep your big

them rabbits if we go about it right."

Curley's wife moved away from him a little. "I think you're nuts," 
she said. 
 
 "No I ain't," Lennie explained earnestly. "George says I ain't. I 
like to pet nice things with my fingers, sof' things. " 
 
 She was a little bit reassured. "Well, who don't?" she said. 
"Ever'body likes that. I like to feel silk an' velvet. Do you like to 
feel velvet?" 
 
 Lennie chuckled with pleasure. "You bet, by God," he cried 
happily. "An' I had some, too. A lady give me some, an' that lady

Well, I wasn't gonna stay no place where I couldn't get nowhere or 
make something of myself, an' where they stole your letters. I ast 
her if she stole it, too, an' she says no. So I married Curley. Met 
him out to the Riverside Dance Palace that same night." She 
demanded, "You listenin'?" 
 
 "Me? Sure."

 George said, "She's gonna make a mess. They's gonna be a bad

was--my own Aunt Clara. She give it right to me-'bout this big a 
piece. I wisht I had that velvet right now." A frown came over his 
face. "I lost it," he said. "I ain't seen it for a long time." 
 
 Curley's wife laughed at him. "You're nuts," she said. "But you're 
a kinda nice fella. Jus' like a big baby. But a person can see kinda

Slim said, "Well, you been askin' me too often. I'm gettin' God

what you expect me to do about it? You lay offa me." 
 
 "I'm jus' tryin' to tell you I didn't mean nothing," said Curley. "I 
jus' thought you might of saw her." 
 
 "Why'n't you tell her to stay the hell home where she belongs?" 
said Carlson. "You let her hang around bunk houses and pretty

 George looked around at Lennie. "Jesus, what a tramp," he said. 
"So that's what Curley picks for a wife." 
 
 "She's purty," said Lennie defensively. 
 
 "Yeah, and she's sure hidin' it. Curley got his work ahead of him. 
Bet she'd clear out for twenty bucks." 
 
 Lennie still stared at the doorway where she had been. "Gosh, she 
was purty." He smiled admiringly. George looked quickly down at 
him and then he took him by an ear and shook him.

"Look, Slim's bitch got a litter right now. I bet Slim would give you 
one of them pnps to raise up, wouldn't you, Slim?"

Slim took his eyes from old Candy. "Huh? Oh! Hello, Crooks. 
What's'a matter?" 
 
 "You told me to warm up tar for that mule's foot. I got it warm." 
 
 "Oh! Sure, Crooks. I'll come right out an' put it on." 
 
 "I can do it if you want, Mr. Slim." 
 
 "No. I'll come do it myself." He stood up. 
 
 Crooks said, "Mr. Slim." 
 
 "Yeah." 
 
 "That big new guy's messin' around your pups out in the barn." 
 
 "Well, he ain't doin' no harm. I give him one of them pups."

--- Chunk 7 ---
somebody's out there," Crooks said. "Maybe Slim. Slim comes in 
sometimes two, three times a night. Slim's a real skinner. He 
looks out for his team." He pulled himself painfully upright and 
moved toward the door. "That you, Slim?" he called. 
 
 Candy's voice answered. "Slim went in town. Say, you seen 
Lennie?" 
 
 "Ya mean the big guy?" 
 
 "Yeah. Seen him around any place?" 
 
 "He's in here," Crooks said shortly. He went back to his bunk and 
lay down.

--- Chunk 8 ---
"All right. But don’t try to put nothing over, ’cause you can’t get 
away with nothing. I seen wise guys before. Go on out with the 
grain teams after dinner. They’re pickin’ up barley at the 
threshing machine. Go out with Slim’s team." 
 
 "Slim?" 
 
 "Yeah. Big tall skinner. You’ll see him at dinner." He turned 
abruptly and went to the door, but before he went out he turned 
and looked for a long moment at the two men. 
 
 When the sound of his footsteps had died away George turned on

"'Course he ain't mean. But he gets in trouble alla time because 
he's so God damn dumb. Like what happened in Weed-" he 
stopped, stopped in the middle of turning over a card. He looked 
alarmed and peered over at Slim. "You wouldn't tell nobody?" 
 
 "What'd he do in Weed?" Slim asked calmly. 
 
 "You wouldn' tell? . . . . No, 'course you wouldn'." 
 
 "What'd he do in Weed?" Slim asked again. 
 
 "Well, he seen this girl in a red dress. Dumb bastard like he is, he

all the time. 
 
 "Yeah, they get mean," Slim agreed. "They get so they don't want 
to talk to nobody." 
 
 "'Course Lennie's a God damn nuisance most of the time," said 
George. "But you get used to goin' around with a guy an' you can't 
get rid of him." 
 
 "He ain't mean," said Slim. "I can see Lennie ain't a bit mean."

=== Question 19 ===
Why does Carlson suggest shooting Candy's dog?

--- Chunk 1 ---
During the conversation Carlson had refused to be drawn in. He 
continued to look down at the old dog. Candy watched him 
uneasily. At last Carlson said, "if you want me to, I'll put the old 
devil out of his misery right now and get it over with. Ain't 
nothing left for him. Can't eat, can't see, can't even walk without 
hurtin'." 
 
 Candy said hopefully, "You ain't got no gun." 
 
 "The hell I ain't. Got a Luger. It won't hurt him none at all."

 Candy said hopefully, "You ain't got no gun." 
 
 "The hell I ain't. Got a Luger. It won't hurt him none at all."

--- Chunk 4 ---
Candy looked about unhappily. "No," he said softly. "No, I 
couldn't do that. I had 'im too long." 
 
 "He don't have no fun," Carlson insisted. "And he stinks to beat 
hell. Tell you what. I'll shoot him for you. Then it won't be you 
that does it." 
 
 Candy threw his legs off his bunk. He scratched the white stubble 
whiskers on his check nervously. 
 
   
 
 "I'm so used to him," he said softly. "I had him from a pup."

shake himself free for speech. "Carl's right, Candy. That dog ain't 
no good to himself. I wisht somebody'd shoot me if I get old an' a 
cripple." 
 
 Candy looked helplessly at him, for Slim's opinions were law. 
"Maybe it'd hurt him," he suggested. "I don't mind takin' care of 
him." 
 
 Carlson said, "The way I'd shoot him, he wouldn't feel nothing. I'd 
put the gun right there." He pointed with his toe. "Right back of 
the head. He wouldn't even quiver."

--- Chunk 7 ---
That dog of Candy's is so God damn old he can't hardly walk. 
Stinks like hell, too. Ever' time he comes into the bunk house I can 
smell him for two, three days. Why'n't you get Candy to shoot his 
old dog and give him one of the pups to raise up? I can smell that 
dog a mile away. Got no teeth, damn near blind, can't eat. Candy 
feeds him milk. He can't chew nothing else." 
 
 George had been staring intently at Slim. Suddenly a triangle

"Don't tell nobody," Lennie said to himself. 
 
 Candy said, "George." 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "I ought to of shot that dog myself, George. I shouldn't ought to of 
let no stranger shoot my dog." 
 
 The door opened. Slim came in, followed by Curley and Carlson 
and Whit. Slim's hands were black with tar and he was scowling. 
Curley hung close to his elbow. 
 
 Curley said, "Well, I didn't mean nothing, Slim. I just ast you." 
 
 Slim said, "Well, you been askin' me too often. I'm gettin' God

--- Chunk 9 ---
Carlson finished the cleaning of the gun and put it in the bag and 
pushed the bag under his bunk. "I guess I'll go out and look her 
over," he said. Old Candy lay still, and Lennie, from his bunk, 
watched George cautiously. 
 
 When Whit and Carlson were gone and the door closed after 
them, George turned to Lennie. "What you got on your mind?" 
 
 "I ain't done nothing, George. Slim says I better not pet them 
pups so much for a while. Slim says it ain't good for them; so I

the ancient dog, and he apologized, "I been around him so much I 
never notice how he stinks." 
 
 "Well, I can't stand him in here," said Carlson. "That stink hangs 
around even after he's gone." He walked over with his heavy-
legged stride and looked down at the dog. "Got no teeth," he said. 
"He's all stiff with rheumatism. He ain't no good to you, Candy. 
An' he ain't no good to himself. Why'n't you shoot him, Candy?" 
 
 The old man squirmed uncomfortably. "Well-hell! I had him so


=== Question 20 ===
What is the understood question that Lennie wants George to ask Slim?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Slim is. But I like to see the fuss if it comes off. Come on, le's go." 
 
 George said, "I'm stayin' right here. I don't want to get mixed up

 George spoke proudly. "Jus' tell Lennie what to do an' he'll do it if 
it don't take no figuring. He can't think of nothing to do himself, 
but he sure can take orders." 
 
 There was a clang of horseshoe on iron stake outside and a little 
cheer of voices. 
 
 Slim moved back slightly so the light was not on his face. "Funny 
how you an' him string along together." It was Slim's calm 
invitation to confidence. 
 
 "What's funny about it?" George demanded defensively.

--- Chunk 6 ---
Lennie, who had been following the conversation back and forth 
with his eyes, smiled complacency at the compliment. Slim looked 
approvingly at George for having given the compliment. He leaned 
over the table and snapped the corner of a loose card. "You guys 
travel around together?" His tone was friendly. It invited 
confidence without demanding it. 
 
 "Sure," said George. "We kinda look after each other." He 
indicated Lennie with his thumb. "He ain't bright. Hell of a good

Luger," and he ran out too. 
 
 Slim turned quietly to George. "I guess Lennie done it, all right," 
he said. "Her neck's bust. Lennie coulda did that." 
 
 George didn't answer, but he nodded slowly. His hat was so far 
down on his forehead that his eyes were covered. 
 
 Slim went on, "Maybe like that time in Weed you was tellin' 
about." 
 
 Again George nodded.

--- Chunk 9 ---

guy. You seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?" 
 
 "Sure," said George. "I seen plenty tough little guys. But this 
Curley better not make no mistakes about Lennie. Lennie ain’t 
handy, but this Curley punk is gonna get' hurt if he messes

"It ain't so funny, him an' me goin' aroun' together," George said 
at last. "Him and me was both born in Auburn. I knowed his Aunt

his Aunt Clara died, Lennie just come along with me out workin'. 
Got kinda used to each other after a little while." 
 
 "Umm," said Slim. 
 
 George looked over at Slim and saw the calm, Godlike eyes 
fastened on him. "Funny," said George. "I used to have a hell of a

We'll have trouble keepin' him from getting right in the box with 
them pups." 
 
 "It wasn't nothing," Slim repeated. "Say, you sure was right about 
him. Maybe he ain't bright, but I never seen such a worker. He 
damn near killed his partner buckin' barley. There ain't nobody 
can keep up with him. God awmighty I never seen such a strong

 "You get a kick outta that, don’t you? Awright, I’ll tell you, and

 "No. Anyways I never seen her." 
 
 "You never seen Slim talkin' to her?" 
 
 "Uh-uh. She ain't been in the barn." 
 
 "O.K.," said George. "I guess them guys ain't gonna see no fight. If 
there's any fightin', Lennie, you keep out of it." 
 
 "I don't want no fights," said Lennie. He got up from his bunk and

I wasn't drunk. I don't know if I was asleep. If some guy was with 
me, he could tell me I was asleep, an' then it would be all right. 
But I jus' don't know." Crooks was looking across the room now, 
looking toward the window. 
 
 Lennie said miserably, "George won't go away and leave me. I 
know George wun't do that." 
 
 The stable buck went on dreamily, "I remember when I was a

 Lennie sat up quickly. "Give 'um to me, George." 
 
 George said, "You get right up an' take this pup back to the nest. 
He's gotta sleep with his mother. You want to kill him? Just born 
last night an' you take him out of the nest. You take him back or 
I'll tell Slim not to let you have him." 
 
 Lennie held out his hands pleadingly. "Give 'um to me, George. 
I'll take 'um back. I didn't mean no harm, George. Honest I didn't.

Lennie giggled happily. "I didn’t forget that, you bet." 
 
 George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his 
head, and Lennie imitated him, raising his head to see whether he 
were doing it right. "God, you’re a lot of trouble," said George. "I 
could get along so easy and so nice if I didn’t have you on my tail. I 
could live so easy and maybe have a girl." 
 
 For a moment Lennie lay quiet, and then he said hopefully, "We

Got kinda used to each other after a little while." 
 
 "Umm," said Slim. 
 
 George looked over at Slim and saw the calm, Godlike eyes 
fastened on him. "Funny," said George. "I used to have a hell of a

indicated Lennie with his thumb. "He ain't bright. Hell of a good 
worker, though. Hell of a nice fella, but he ain't bright. I've knew 
him for a long time." 
 
 Slim looked through George and beyond him. "Ain't many guys 
travel around together," he mused. "I don't know why. Maybe 
ever'body in the whole damn world is scared of each other." 
 
 "It's a lot nicer to go around with a guy you know," said George. 
 
 A powerful, big-stomached man came into the bunk house. His

Lennie stuck out his hands. 
 
 "Christ awmighty, I hate to have you mad at me," Slim said. 
 
 George broke in, "Lennie was jus' scairt," he explained. "He didn't 
know what to do. I told you nobody ought never to fight him. No, I 
guess it was Candy I told." 
 
 Candy nodded solemnly. "That's jus' what you done," he said. 
"Right this morning when Curley first lit into your fren', you says, 
'He better not fool with Lennie if he knows what's good for 'um.'

--- Chunk 9 ---
Lennie, who had been following the conversation back and forth 
with his eyes, smiled complacency at the compliment. Slim looked 
approvingly at George for having given the compliment. He leaned 
over the table and snapped the corner of a loose card. "You guys 
travel around together?" His tone was friendly. It invited 
confidence without demanding it. 
 
 "Sure," said George. "We kinda look after each other." He 
indicated Lennie with his thumb. "He ain't bright. Hell of a good

was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so 
you can almost see it." 
 
 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the 
darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," 
George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of 
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined.

 His voice grew soft and persuasive. "S'pose George don't come 
back no more. S'pose he took a powder and just ain't coming back. 
What'll you do then?" 
 
 Lennie's attention came gradually to what had been said. "What?" 
he demanded. 
 
 "I said s'pose George went into town tonight and you never heard 
of him no more." Crooks pressed forward some kind of private 
victory. "Just s'pose that," he repeated.

fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s face was drawn with terror. 
"An’ whatta I got," George went on furiously. "I got you! You can’t 
keep a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me shovin’ all

Lennie." 
 
 "Sure I will, George. I won't say a word." 
 
 "Don't let him pull you in-but-if the son-of-abitch socks you-let 'im 
have it." 
 
 "Let 'im have what, George?" 
 
 "Never mind, never mind. I'll tell you when. I hate that kind of a 
guy. Look, Lennie, if you get in any kind of trouble, you remember 
what I told you to do?" 
 
 Lennie raised up on his elbow. His face contorted with thought.

--- Chunk 8 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

'He better not fool with Lennie if he knows what's good for 'um.' 
That's jus' what you says to me." 
 
 George turned to Lennie. "It ain't your fault," he said. "You don't 
need to be scairt no more. You done jus' what I tol' you to. Maybe 
you better go in the ' wash room an' clean up your face. You look 
like' hell." 
 
 Lennie smiled with his bruised mouth. "I didn't want no trouble," 
he said. He walked toward the door, but just before he came to it, 
he turned back. "George?"

guy. You seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?" 
 
 "Sure," said George. "I seen plenty tough little guys. But this 
Curley better not make no mistakes about Lennie. Lennie ain’t

 Slim turned quietly to George. "I guess Lennie done it, all right," 
he said. "Her neck's bust. Lennie coulda did that." 
 
 George didn't answer, but he nodded slowly. His hat was so far

 "O.K.," said George. "An’ you ain’t gonna do no bad things like you

 Lennie looked puzzled. "Like I done in Weed?" 
 
 "Oh, so ya forgot that too, did ya. Well, I ain’t gonna remind ya, 
fear ya do it again." 
 
 A light of understanding broke on Lennie’s face. "They run us

 "Run us out, hell," said George disgustedly. "We run. They was

 Again George nodded. 
 
 Slim sighed. "Well, I guess we got to get him. Where you think he

 It seemed to take George some time to free his words. "He-would 
of went south," he said. "We come from north so he would of went 
south." 
 
 "I guess we gotta get 'im," Slim repeated. 
 
 George stepped close. "Couldn' we maybe bring him in an' they'll

 "I won’t get in no trouble, George. I ain’t gonna say a word." 
 
 "O.K. Bring your bindle over here by the fire. It’s gonna be nice 
sleepin’ here. Lookin’ up, and the leaves. Don’t build up no more 
fire. We’ll let her die down." 
 
 They made their beds on the sand, and as the blaze dropped from 
the fire the sphere of light grew smaller; the curling branches 
disappeared and only a faint glimmer showed where the tree 
trunks were. From the darkness Lennie called, "George - you

system all at once, an' no messes. And he knows how much it's 
gonna set him back. These here jail baits is just set on the trigger 
of the hoosegow." 
 
 Lennie followed his words admiringly, and moved his lips a little 
to keep up. George continued, "You remember Andy Cushman, 
Lennie? Went to grammar school?" 
 
 "The one that his old lady used to make hot cakes for the kids?" 
Lennie asked.

 His voice grew soft and persuasive. "S'pose George don't come

Maybe you wouldn’t killit. That’d be better than. mice. And you 
could pet it harder." 
 
 Lennie avoided the bait. He had sensed his advantage, "If you 
don’t want me, you only jus’ got to say so, and I’ll go off in those 
hills right there - right up in those hills and live by myself. An’ I 
won’t get no mice stole from me." 
 
 George said, "I want you to stay with me, Lennie. Jesus Christ,

=== Question 25 ===
Who makes the final decision on whether or not Candy's old dog should be shot?

--- Chunk 1 ---
During the conversation Carlson had refused to be drawn in. He 
continued to look down at the old dog. Candy watched him 
uneasily. At last Carlson said, "if you want me to, I'll put the old 
devil out of his misery right now and get it over with. Ain't 
nothing left for him. Can't eat, can't see, can't even walk without 
hurtin'." 
 
 Candy said hopefully, "You ain't got no gun." 
 
 "The hell I ain't. Got a Luger. It won't hurt him none at all."

Carlson finished the cleaning of the gun and put it in the bag and 
pushed the bag under his bunk. "I guess I'll go out and look her 
over," he said. Old Candy lay still, and Lennie, from his bunk, 
watched George cautiously. 
 
 When Whit and Carlson were gone and the door closed after 
them, George turned to Lennie. "What you got on your mind?"

That dog of Candy's is so God damn old he can't hardly walk. 
Stinks like hell, too. Ever' time he comes into the bunk house I can 
smell him for two, three days. Why'n't you get Candy to shoot his 
old dog and give him one of the pups to raise up? I can smell that 
dog a mile away. Got no teeth, damn near blind, can't eat. Candy 
feeds him milk. He can't chew nothing else." 
 
 George had been staring intently at Slim. Suddenly a triangle

"Don't tell nobody," Lennie said to himself. 
 
 Candy said, "George." 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "I ought to of shot that dog myself, George. I shouldn't ought to of 
let no stranger shoot my dog." 
 
 The door opened. Slim came in, followed by Curley and Carlson 
and Whit. Slim's hands were black with tar and he was scowling. 
Curley hung close to his elbow. 
 
 Curley said, "Well, I didn't mean nothing, Slim. I just ast you." 
 
 Slim said, "Well, you been askin' me too often. I'm gettin' God

Candy looked about unhappily. "No," he said softly. "No, I 
couldn't do that. I had 'im too long." 
 
 "He don't have no fun," Carlson insisted. "And he stinks to beat 
hell. Tell you what. I'll shoot him for you. Then it won't be you 
that does it." 
 
 Candy threw his legs off his bunk. He scratched the white stubble 
whiskers on his check nervously. 
 
   
 
 "I'm so used to him," he said softly. "I had him from a pup."

shake himself free for speech. "Carl's right, Candy. That dog ain't 
no good to himself. I wisht somebody'd shoot me if I get old an' a 
cripple." 
 
 Candy looked helplessly at him, for Slim's opinions were law. 
"Maybe it'd hurt him," he suggested. "I don't mind takin' care of 
him." 
 
 Carlson said, "The way I'd shoot him, he wouldn't feel nothing. I'd 
put the gun right there." He pointed with his toe. "Right back of 
the head. He wouldn't even quiver."

--- Chunk 10 ---
"He's plenty good," said Slim. 
 
 "Damn right he is," said Carlson. "He don't give nobody else a 
chance to win-" He stopped and sniffed the air, and still sniffing, 
looked down at the old dog. "God awmighty, that dog stinks. Get 
him outa here, Candy! I don't know nothing that stinks as bad as 
an old dog. You gotta get him out." 
 
 Candy rolled to the edge of his bunk. He reached over and patted 
the ancient dog, and he apologized, "I been around him so much I

 George said wonderingly, "S'pose they was a carnival or a circus

nodded in appreciation of the idea. "We'd just go to her," George 
said. "We wouldn't ask nobody if we could. Jus' say, 'We'll go to

 George said softly, "-I think I knowed from the very first I think I 
knowed we'd never do her. He usta like to hear about it so much I

 George scowled. "I thought I tol' you not to tell nobody about

 Candy was crestfallen. "Didn't tell nobody but Crooks." 
 
 George said, "Well you guys get outta here. Jesus, seems like I

won't have you messin' with Lennie." 
 
 "Who's George?" she asked. "The little guy you come with?" 
 
 Lennie smiled happily. "That's him," he said. "That's the guy, an' 
he's gonna let me tend the rabbits." 
 
 "Well, if that's all you want, I might get a couple rabbits myself." 
 
 Crooks stood up from his bunk and faced her. "I had enough," he

Candy cried, "Sure they all want it. Everybody wants a little bit of

 "In one month. Right squack in one month. Know what I'm gon'ta

 "Yeah, and she's sure hidin' it. Curley got his work ahead of him. 
Bet she'd clear out for twenty bucks." 
 
 Lennie still stared at the doorway where she had been. "Gosh, she 
was purty." He smiled admiringly. George looked quickly down at 
him and then he took him by an ear and shook him.

--- Chunk 7 ---
"I won't tell," said Curley. He avoided looking at Lennie. 
 
 Buggy wheels sounded outside. Slim helped Curley up. "Come on 
now. Carlson's gonna take you to a doctor." He helped Curley out 
the door. The sound of wheels drew away. In a moment Slim came 
back into the bunk house. He looked at Lennie, still crouched 
fearfully against the wall. "Le's see your hands," he asked. 
 
 Lennie stuck out his hands. 
 
 "Christ awmighty, I hate to have you mad at me," Slim said.

--- Chunk 8 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

looked sullenly up at her.She said, "What you got there, sonny 
boy?" 
 
 Lennie glared at her. "George says I ain't to have nothing to do 
with you-talk to you or nothing." 
 
 She laughed "George giving you orders about everything?" 
 
 Lennie looked down at the hay. "Says I can't tend no rabbits if I 
talk to you or anything." 
 
 She said quietly, "He's scared Curley'll get mad. Well, Curley got 
his arm in a sling-an' if Curley gets tough, you can break his other

go along an' roll your hoop. We ain't got nothing to say to you at 
all. We know what we got, and we don't care whether you know it 
or not. So maybe you better jus' scatter along now, 'cause Curley 
maybe ain't gonna like his wife out in the barn with us `bindle 
stiffs."' 
 
 She looked from one face to another, and they were all closed 
against her. And she looked longest at Lennie, until he dropped


=== Question 29 ===
Why does Curley agree not to get Lennie fired for crushing his hand?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Curley's fist was swinging when Lennie reached for it. The next 
minute Curley was flopping like a fish on a line, and his closed fist 
was lost in Lennie's big hand. George ran down the room. "Leggo 
of him, Lennie. Let go." 
 
   
 
 But Lennie watched in terror the flopping little man whom he 
held. Blood ran down Lennie's face; one of his eyes was cut and 
closed. George slapped him in the face again and again, and still

 "Well, let him be handy," said George, "He don’t have to take after 
Lennie. Lennie didn’t do nothing to him. What’s he got against 
Lennie?" 
 
 The swamper considered..... "Well.... tell you what. Curley’s like a

 "Let 'im have what, George?" 
 
 "Never mind, never mind. I'll tell you when. I hate that kind of a

 Lennie raised up on his elbow. His face contorted with thought.

 "Well, Curley’s pretty handy," the swamper said skeptically. 
"Never did seem right to me. S'pose Curley jumps a big guy an’ 
licks him. Ever’body says what a game guy Curley is. And s’pose 
he does the same thing and gets licked. Then ever’body says the 
big guy oughtta pick somebody his own size, and maybe they gang 
up on the big guy. Never did seem right to me. Seems like Curley 
ain’t givin’ nobody a chance."

--- Chunk 10 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have

 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing

 But Lennie watched in terror the flopping little man whom he

the bunk watching him. 
 
 "Look, Lennie! This here ain't no set up. I'm scared. You gonna

kinda feelin' you out. He figures he's got you scared and he's

 Lennie's eyes were frightened. "I don't want no trouble," he said 
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George."

 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him

Why has Crooks been able to accumulate more personal items than the other ranch hands?

Curley said, "You go in Soledad an' get a cop. Get AI Wilts, he's 
deputy sheriff. Le's go now." He turned suspiciously on George. 
"You're comin' with us, fella." 
 
 "Yeah," said George. "I'll come. But listen, Curley. The poor 
bastard's nuts. Don't shoot 'im. He di'n't know what he was doin'." 
 
 "Don't shoot 'im?" Curley cried. "He got Carlson's Luger. 'Course 
we'll shoot 'im. " 
 
 George said weakly, "Maybe Carlson lost his gun.,,

answered. 
 
  "Go on," said Lennie. 
 
 George raised the gun and his hands shook, and he dropped his 
hand to the ground again. 
 
 "Go on," said Lennie. "How's it gonna be. We gonna get a little 
place." 
 
 "We'll have a cow," said George. "An' we'll have maybe a pig an' 
chickens . . . . an' down the flat we'll have a . . . . little piece alfalfa-
" 
 
 "For the rabbits," Lennie shouted. 
 
 "For the rabbits," George repeated. 
 
 "And I get to tend the rabbits."

--- Chunk 3 ---
"Yeah. Tha's how." George's voice was almost a whisper. He 
looked steadily at his right hand that had held the gun. 
 
 Slim twitched George's elbow. "Come on, George. Me an' you'll go 
in an' get a drink." 
 
 George let himself be helped to his feet. "Yeah, a drink." 
 
 Slim said, "You hadda, George. I swear you had-da. Come on with 
me." He led George into the entrance of the trail and up toward 
the highway. 
 
 Curley and Carlson looked after them. And Carlson said, "Now

you can almost see it." 
 
 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the 
darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," 
George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of 
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined.

--- Chunk 5 ---
George moved slowly after them, and his feet dragged heavily. 
 
 And when they were gone, Candy squatted down in the hay and 
watched the face of Curley's wife. "Poor bastard," he said softly. 
 
 The sound of the men grew fainter. The barn was darkening 
gradually and, in their stalls, the horses shifted their feet and 
rattled the halter chains. Old Candy lay down in the hay and 
covered his eyes with his arm. 
 
   
 
   
 
   
 
   
 CHAPTER  6

--- Chunk 6 ---
George stepped close. "Couldn' we maybe bring him in an' they'll 
lock him up? He's nuts, Slim. He never done this to be mean." 
 
 Slim nodded. "We might," he said. "If we could keep Curley in, we 
might. But Curley's gonna want to shoot 'im. Curley's still mad 
about his hand. An' s'pose they lock him up an' strap him down 
and put him in a cage. That ain't no good, George." 
 
 "I know," said George. "I know."

--- Chunk 7 ---
"The hell you wouldn'," said the rabbit. "You ain't worth a greased 
jack-pin to ram you into hell. Christ knows George done ever'thing 
he could to jack you outa the sewer, but it don't do no good. If you 
think George gonna let you tend rabbits, you're even crazier'n 
usual. He ain't. He's gonna bear hell outa you with a stick, that's 
what he's gonna do." 
 
 Now Lennie retorted belligerently, "He ain't neither. George won't

 Curley and Carlson looked after them. And Carlson said, "Now 
what the hell ya suppose is eatin' them two guys?"

--- Chunk 9 ---
"An' when the end of the month come I could take my fifty bucks 
an' go to a . . . . cat house. . . ." He stopped again. 
 
 Lennie looked eagerly at him. "Go on, George. Ain't you gonna 
give me no more hell?" 
 
 "No," said George. 
 
 "Well, I can go away," said Lennie. "I'll go right off in the hills an' 
find a cave if you don' want me." 
 
 George shook himself again. "No," he said. "I want you to stay 
with me here." 
 
 Lennie said craftily- "Tell me like you done before."

What reason does Crooks first give for Lennie not being welcome in his room?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Crooks said sharply, "You got no right to come in my room. This 
here's my room. Nobody got any right in here but me." 
 
 Lennie gulped and his smile grew more fawning. "I ain't doing 
nothing," he said. "Just come to look at my puppy. And I seen your 
light," he explained. 
 
 "Well, I got a right to have a light. You go on get outta my room. I 
ain't wanted in the bunk house, and you ain't wanted in my room." 
 
 "Why ain't you wanted?" Lennie asked.

 "Why ain't you wanted?" Lennie asked.

--- Chunk 4 ---
"It's George," Lennie cried. And he answered, "Here, George. I'm 
right in here." 
 
 In a second George stood framed in the door, and he looked 
disapprovingly about. "What you doin' in Crooks' room? You 
hadn't ought to lie here." 
 
 Crooks nodded "I tol' 'em, but they come in anyways." 
 
 "Well, why'n't you kick'em out?" 
 
 "I di'n't care much," said Crooks. "Lennie's a nice fella." 
 
 Now Candy aroused himself. "Oh, George! I been figurin' and

Slim says I ain't to pet 'em very much." 
 
 Crooks said, "Well, you been takin' 'em out of the nest all the 
time. I wonder the old lady don't move 'em someplace else." 
 
 "Oh, she don't care. She lets me." Lennie had moved into the room 
again. 
 
 Crooks scowled, but Lennie's disarming smile defeated him. 
"Come on in and set a while," Crooks said. "'Long as you won't get 
out and leave me alone, you might as well set down." His tone was

"He's in here," Crooks said shortly. He went back to his bunk and 
lay down. 
 
 Candy stood in the doorway scratching his bald wrist and looking 
blindly into the lighted room. He made no attempt to enter. "Tell 
ya what, Lennie. I been figuring out about them rabbits." 
 
 Crooks said irritably, "You can come in if you want." 
 
 Candy seemed embarrassed. "I do' know. 'Course, if ya want me 
to." 
 
 "Come on in. If ever'body's comin' in, you might just as well." It

Crooks bored in on him. "Want me to tell ya what'll happen? 
They'll take ya to the booby hatch. They'll tie ya up with a collar, 
like a dog." 
 
 Suddenly Lennie's eyes. centered and grew quiet, and mad. He 
stood up and walked dangerously toward Crooks. "Who hurt 
George?" he demanded. 
 
 Crooks saw the danger as it approached him. He edged back on 
his bunk to get out of the way. "I was just supposin'," he said. 
"George ain't hurt. He's all right. He'll be back all right."

--- Chunk 9 ---
to." 
 
 "Come on in. If ever'body's comin' in, you might just as well." It 
was difficult for Crooks to conceal his pleasure with anger. 
 
 Candy came in, but he was still embarrassed. "You got a nice cozy 
little place in here," he said to Crooks. "Must be nice to have a 
room all to yourself this way." 
 
 "Sure," said Crooks. "And a manure pile under the window. Sure,

the bunk watching him. 
 
 "Look, Lennie! This here ain't no set up. I'm scared. You gonna 
have trouble with that Curley guy. I seen that kind before. He was 
kinda feelin' you out. He figures he's got you scared and he's 
gonna take a sock at you the first chance he gets." 
 
 Lennie's eyes were frightened. "I don't want no trouble," he said 
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George."

 "The rabbits we're gonna get, and I get to tend 'em, cut grass an' 
give 'em water, an' like that." 
 
 "Jus' nuts," said Crooks. "I don't blame the guy you travel with for

 Lennie said quietly, "It ain't no lie. We're gonna do it. Gonna get a

men, and he had accumulated more possessions than he could 
carry on his back. 
 
 Crooks possessed several pairs of shoes, a pair of rubber boots, a 
big alarm clock and a single-barreled shotgun. And he had books, 
too; a tattered dictionary and a mauled copy of the California civil 
code for 1905. There were battered magazines and a few dirty 
books on a special shelf over his bunk. A pair of large gold-rimmed 
spectacles hung from a nail on the wall above his bed.

--- Chunk 8 ---
Crooks said gently, "Maybe you can see now. You got George. 
Youknow he's goin' to come back. S'pose you didn't have nobody. 
S'pose you couldn't go into the bunk house and play rummy 'cause 
you was black. How'd you like that? S'pose you had to sit out here 
an' read books. Sure you could play horseshoes till it got dark, but 
then you got to read books. Books ain't no good. A guy needs

 Lennie spoke craftily, "Tell me - like you done before."

What is Crooks's initial response to Candy's account of the dream farm and what evidence is there that his attitude changes?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Candy quickly changed the subject. "Slim's as good a skinner as I 
ever seen." 
 
 Lennie leaned toward the old swamper "About them rabbits," he 
insisted. 
 
 Candy smiled. "I got it figured out. We can make some money on 
them rabbits if we go about it right." 
 
 "But I get to tend'em," Lennie broke in. "George says I get to tend 
'em. He promised." 
 
 Crooks interrupted brutally. "You guys is just kiddin' yourself.

 Candy smiled. "I got it figured out. We can make some money on 
them rabbits if we go about it right." 
 
 "But I get to tend'em," Lennie broke in. "George says I get to tend 
'em. He promised." 
 
 Crooks interrupted brutally. "You guys is just kiddin' yourself.

Candy quickly changed the subject. "Slim's as good a skinner as I 
ever seen." 
 
 Lennie leaned toward the old swamper "About them rabbits," he

 Candy smiled. "I got it figured out. We can make some money on

Now Candy aroused himself. "Oh, George! I been figurin' and 
figurin'. I got it doped out how we can even make some money on 
them rabbits." 
 
 George scowled. "I thought I tol' you not to tell nobody about 
that." 
 
 Candy was crestfallen. "Didn't tell nobody but Crooks." 
 
 George said, "Well you guys get outta here. Jesus, seems like I 
can't go away for a minute." 
 
 Candy and Lennie stood up and went toward the door. Crooks 
called, "Candy!" 
 
 "Huh?"

Candy and Lennie stood up and went toward the door. Crooks 
called, "Candy!" 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "'Member what I said about hoein' and doin' odd jobs?" 
 
 "Yeah," said Candy. "I remember." 
 
 "Well, jus' forget it," said Crooks. "I didn' mean it. Jus' foolin'. I 
wouldn' want to go no place like that." 
 
 "Well, O.K., if you feel like that. Good-night"

--- Chunk 7 ---
"He's in here," Crooks said shortly. He went back to his bunk and 
lay down. 
 
 Candy stood in the doorway scratching his bald wrist and looking 
blindly into the lighted room. He made no attempt to enter. "Tell 
ya what, Lennie. I been figuring out about them rabbits." 
 
 Crooks said irritably, "You can come in if you want." 
 
 Candy seemed embarrassed. "I do' know. 'Course, if ya want me 
to." 
 
 "Come on in. If ever'body's comin' in, you might just as well." It

 "Come on in. If ever'body's comin' in, you might just as well." It 
was difficult for Crooks to conceal his pleasure with anger. 
 
 Candy came in, but he was still embarrassed. "You got a nice cozy 
little place in here," he said to Crooks. "Must be nice to have a 
room all to yourself this way." 
 
 "Sure," said Crooks. "And a manure pile under the window. Sure,

 Crooks interrupted brutally. "You guys is just kiddin' yourself. 
You'll talk about it a hell of a lot, but you won't get no land. You'll 
be a swamper here till they take you out in a box. Hell, I seen too 
many guys. Lennie here'll quit an' be on the road in two, three 
weeks. Seems like ever' guy got land in his head." 
 
 Candy rubbed his cheek angrily. "You God damn right we're 
gonna do it. George says we are. We got the money right now."

--- Chunk 10 ---
"It's George," Lennie cried. And he answered, "Here, George. I'm 
right in here." 
 
 In a second George stood framed in the door, and he looked 
disapprovingly about. "What you doin' in Crooks' room? You 
hadn't ought to lie here." 
 
 Crooks nodded "I tol' 'em, but they come in anyways." 
 
 "Well, why'n't you kick'em out?" 
 
 "I di'n't care much," said Crooks. "Lennie's a nice fella." 
 
 Now Candy aroused himself. "Oh, George! I been figurin' and

Curley's wife moved away from him a little. "I think you're nuts," 
she said. 
 
 "No I ain't," Lennie explained earnestly. "George says I ain't. I 
like to pet nice things with my fingers, sof' things. " 
 
 She was a little bit reassured. "Well, who don't?" she said. 
"Ever'body likes that. I like to feel silk an' velvet. Do you like to

 Lennie chuckled with pleasure. "You bet, by God," he cried

Curley's wife.

Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him

went quickly out of the barn. 
 
 Old Candy watched him go. He looked helplessly back at Curley's 
wife, and gradually his sorrow and his anger grew into words.

--- Chunk 4 ---
he said quietly. "If you go right now, we won't tell Curley you was 
here." 
 
 She appraised him coolly. "I ain't sure you heard nothing." 
 
 "Better not take no chances," he said. "If you ain't sure, you better 
take the safe way." 
 
 She turned to Lennie. "I'm glad you bust up Curley a little bit. He 
got it comin' to him. Sometimes I'd like to bust him myself." She 
slipped out the door and disappeared into the dark barn. And

But Candy said excitedly, "We oughtta let'im get away. You don't 
know that Curley. Curley gon'ta wanta get 'im lynched. Curley'll 
get 'im killed." 
 
 George watched Candy's lips. "Yeah," he said at last, "that's right, 
Curley will. An' the other guys will." And he looked back at 
Curley's wife. 
 
 Now Candy spoke his greatest fear. "You an' me can get that little 
place, can't we, George? You an' me can go there an' live nice, can't 
we, George? Can't we?"

here." 
 
 Candy stepped over to him. "Don't you worry none," he said. "I 
jus' heard the guys comin' in. George'll be in the bunk house right 
now, I bet." He turned to Curley's wife. "You better go home now,"

--- Chunk 8 ---
Lennie watched her, fascinated; but Candy and Crooks were 
scowling down away from her eyes. Candy said, "Then if you 
know, why you want to ast us where Curley is at?" 
 
 She regarded them amusedly. "Funny thing," she said. "If I catch 
any one man, and he's alone, I get along fine with him. But just let 
two of the guys get together an' you won't talk. Jus' nothing but 
mad" She dropped her fingers and put her hands on her hips.

go along an' roll your hoop. We ain't got nothing to say to you at 
all. We know what we got, and we don't care whether you know it 
or not. So maybe you better jus' scatter along now, 'cause Curley 
maybe ain't gonna like his wife out in the barn with us `bindle 
stiffs."' 
 
 She looked from one face to another, and they were all closed 
against her. And she looked longest at Lennie, until he dropped

his eyes in embarrassment. Suddenly she said, "Where'd you get 
them bruises on your face?" 
 
 Lennie looked up guiltily. "Who-me?" 
 
 "Yeah, you." 
 
 Lennie looked to Candy for help, and then he looked at his lap 
again. "He got his han' caught in a machine," he said. 
 
 Curley's wife laughed. "O.K., Machine. I'll talk to you later. I like 
machines." 
 
 Candy broke in. "You let this guy alone. Don't you do no messing


=== Question 40 ===
What does George say about Candy and Lennie visiting with Crooks?

--- Chunk 1 ---
"It's George," Lennie cried. And he answered, "Here, George. I'm 
right in here." 
 
 In a second George stood framed in the door, and he looked 
disapprovingly about. "What you doin' in Crooks' room? You 
hadn't ought to lie here." 
 
 Crooks nodded "I tol' 'em, but they come in anyways." 
 
 "Well, why'n't you kick'em out?" 
 
 "I di'n't care much," said Crooks. "Lennie's a nice fella."

figurin'. I got it doped out how we can even make some money on

 George scowled. "I thought I tol' you not to tell nobody about 
that." 
 
 Candy was crestfallen. "Didn't tell nobody but Crooks." 
 
 George said, "Well you guys get outta here. Jesus, seems like I 
can't go away for a minute." 
 
 Candy and Lennie stood up and went toward the door. Crooks 
called, "Candy!" 
 
 "Huh?"

George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my

lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have

 Candy broke in. "You let this guy alone. Don't you do no messing 
aroun' with him. I'm gonna tell George what you says. George 
won't have you messin' with Lennie." 
 
 "Who's George?" she asked. "The little guy you come with?" 
 
 Lennie smiled happily. "That's him," he said. "That's the guy, an' 
he's gonna let me tend the rabbits." 
 
 "Well, if that's all you want, I might get a couple rabbits myself." 
 
 Crooks stood up from his bunk and faced her. "I had enough," he

--- Chunk 9 ---
Candy quickly changed the subject. "Slim's as good a skinner as I 
ever seen." 
 
 Lennie leaned toward the old swamper "About them rabbits," he 
insisted. 
 
 Candy smiled. "I got it figured out. We can make some money on 
them rabbits if we go about it right." 
 
 "But I get to tend'em," Lennie broke in. "George says I get to tend 
'em. He promised." 
 
 Crooks interrupted brutally. "You guys is just kiddin' yourself.

--- Chunk 10 ---
Lennie stuck out his hands. 
 
 "Christ awmighty, I hate to have you mad at me," Slim said. 
 
 George broke in, "Lennie was jus' scairt," he explained. "He didn't 
know what to do. I told you nobody ought never to fight him. No, I 
guess it was Candy I told." 
 
 Candy nodded solemnly. "That's jus' what you done," he said. 
"Right this morning when Curley first lit into your fren', you says, 
'He better not fool with Lennie if he knows what's good for 'um.'


=== Question 41 ===
What has happened to Lennie's puppy and why?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Only Lennie was in the barn, and Lennie sat in the hay beside a 
packing case under a manger in the end of the barn that had not 
been filled with hay. Lennie sat in the hay and looked at a little 
dead puppy that lay in front of him. Lennie looked at it for a long 
time, and then he put out his huge hand and stroked it, stroked it 
clear from one end to the other.

sorrow. 
 
 From outside came the clang of horseshoes on the iron stake, and 
then a little chorus of cries. Lennie got up and brought the puppy 
back and laid it on the hay and sat down. He stroked the pup 
again. "You wasn't big enough," he said. "They tol' me and tol' me 
you wasn't. I di'n't know you'd get killed so easy." He worked his 
fingers on the pup's limp ear. "Maybe George won't care," he said.

trouble." 
 
 She changed the subject. "What you got covered up there?" 
 
 Then all of Lennie's woe came back on him. "Joe my pup," he said 
sadly. "Jus' my little pup." And he swept the hay from on top of it. 
 
 "Why, he's dead," she cried. 
 
 "He was so little," said Lennie. "I was jus' playin' with him . . . . 
an' he made like he's gonna bite me . . . . an' I made like I was

mad. In the brush till he come. Tha's what he said." Lennie went-
back and looked at the dead girl. The puppy lay close to her. 
Lennie picked it up. "I'll throw him away," he said. "It's bad 
enough like it is." He put the pup under his coat, and he crept to

--- Chunk 8 ---
where Lennie had been concealing it against his stomach. 
 
 Lennie sat up quickly. "Give 'um to me, George." 
 
 George said, "You get right up an' take this pup back to the nest. 
He's gotta sleep with his mother. You want to kill him? Just born 
last night an' you take him out of the nest. You take him back or 
I'll tell Slim not to let you have him." 
 
 Lennie held out his hands pleadingly. "Give 'um to me, George. 
I'll take 'um back. I didn't mean no harm, George. Honest I didn't.

--- Chunk 9 ---
Lennie twisted his neck and looked over his shoulder. "Huh? 
What you want, George?" 
 
 "I tol' you you couldn't bring that pup in here." 
 
 "What pup, George? I ain't got no pup." 
 
 George went quickly to him, grabbed him by the shoulder and 
rolled him over. He reached down and picked the tiny puppy from

nothing to do with the horses." 
 
 "The pup," Lennie repeated "I come to see my pup." 
 
 "Well, go see your pup, then. Don't come in a place where you're 
not wanted." 
 
 Lennie lost his smile. He advanced a step into the room, then 
remembered and backed to the door again. "I looked at 'em a little.

 She was a little bit reassured. "Well, who don't?" she said. 
"Ever'body likes that. I like to feel silk an' velvet. Do you like to

George." 
 
 Curley's wife came around the end of the last stall. She came very 
quietly, so that Lennie didn't see her. She wore her bright cotton 
dress and the mules with the red ostrich feathers. Her face was 
made up and the little sausage curls were all in place. She was 
quite near to him before Lennie looked up and saw her. 
 
 In a panic he shoveled hay over the puppy with his fingers. He 
looked sullenly up at her.She said, "What you got there, sonny 
boy?"

--- Chunk 8 ---
"Me? Sure." 
 
 "Well, I ain't told this to nobody before. Maybe I ought'n to. I 
don'like Curley. He ain't a nice fella." And because she had 
confided in him, she moved closer to Lennie and sat beside him.

Lennie's eyes moved down over her body, and though she did not

happily. "An' I had some, too. A lady give me some, an' that lady

George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 7 ---
he said quietly. "If you go right now, we won't tell Curley you was 
here." 
 
 She appraised him coolly. "I ain't sure you heard nothing." 
 
 "Better not take no chances," he said. "If you ain't sure, you better 
take the safe way." 
 
 She turned to Lennie. "I'm glad you bust up Curley a little bit. He 
got it comin' to him. Sometimes I'd like to bust him myself." She 
slipped out the door and disappeared into the dark barn. And

bunk house, and she hurried away. 
 
 George looked around at Lennie. "Jesus, what a tramp," he said. 
"So that's what Curley picks for a wife." 
 
 "She's purty," said Lennie defensively. 
 
 "Yeah, and she's sure hidin' it. Curley got his work ahead of him. 
Bet she'd clear out for twenty bucks." 
 
 Lennie still stared at the doorway where she had been. "Gosh, she 
was purty." He smiled admiringly. George looked quickly down at 
him and then he took him by an ear and shook him.

like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

tried and tried." 
 
 She interrupted him. "All the time he coulda had such a good 
time if it wasn't for you. He woulda took his pay an' raised hell in 
a whore house, and he coulda set in a poolroom an' played 
snooker. But he got to take care of you." 
 
 Lennie moaned with grief. "I know, Aunt Clara, ma'am. I'll go 
right off in the hills an' I'll fin' a cave an' I'll live there so I won't 
be no more trouble to George."


=== Question 45 ===
Why does George say that they can't let Lennie escape to live on his own?

 Lennie avoided the bait. He had sensed his advantage, "If you

hills right there - right up in those hills and live by myself. An’ I

"He won't do it," Lennie cried. "George wouldn't do nothing like 
that. I been with George a long time. He'll come back tonight-" But 
the doubt was too much for him. "Don't you think he will?" 
 
 Crooks' face lighted with pleasure in his torture. 
 
 "Nobody can't tell what a guy'll do," he observed calmly. "Le's say 
he wants to come back and can't. S'pose he gets killed or hurt so 
he can't come back." 
 
 Lennie struggled to understand. "George won't do nothing like

 Lennie struggled to understand. "George won't do nothing like

 "Well, s'pose, jus' s'pose he don't come back. What'll you do then?" 
 
 Lennie's face wrinkled with apprehension. "I don' know. Say,

 George looked quickly and searchingly at him. "I been mean, ain’t 
I?" 
 
 "If you don’ want me I can go off in the hills an’ find a cave. I can 
go away any time." 
 
 "No - look! I was jus’ foolin’, Lennie. ’Cause'. I want you to stay 
with me. Trouble with mice is you always kill ’em." He paused. 
"Tell you what I’ll do, Lennie. First chance I get I'll give you a pup. 
Maybe you wouldn’t killit. That’d be better than. mice. And you

every damn month. Get a gallon of whisky, or set in a pool room 
and play cards or shoot pool." Lennie knelt and looked over the 
fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s face was drawn with terror. 
"An’ whatta I got," George went on furiously. "I got you! You can’t 
keep a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me shovin’ all

What is Candy's greatest fear?

But Candy said excitedly, "We oughtta let'im get away. You don't 
know that Curley. Curley gon'ta wanta get 'im lynched. Curley'll 
get 'im killed." 
 
 George watched Candy's lips. "Yeah," he said at last, "that's right, 
Curley will. An' the other guys will." And he looked back at 
Curley's wife. 
 
 Now Candy spoke his greatest fear. "You an' me can get that little

his eyes in embarrassment. Suddenly she said, "Where'd you get 
them bruises on your face?" 
 
 Lennie looked up guiltily. "Who-me?" 
 
 "Yeah, you." 
 
 Lennie looked to Candy for help, and then he looked at his lap 
again. "He got his han' caught in a machine," he said. 
 
 Curley's wife laughed. "O.K., Machine. I'll talk to you later. I like

She turned at last to the other two. 
 
 Old Candy was watching her, fascinated. "If you was to do that, 
we'd tell," he said quietly. "We'd tell about you framin' Crooks." 
 
 "Tell an' be damned," she cried. "Nobody'd listen to you, an' you 
know it. Nobody'd listen to you." 
 
 Candy subsided. "No ..." he agreed. "Nobody'd listen to us." 
 
 Lennie whined, "I wisht George was here. I wisht George was

 Candy stepped over to him. "Don't you worry none," he said. "I

That dog of Candy's is so God damn old he can't hardly walk. 
Stinks like hell, too. Ever' time he comes into the bunk house I can 
smell him for two, three days. Why'n't you get Candy to shoot his 
old dog and give him one of the pups to raise up? I can smell that 
dog a mile away. Got no teeth, damn near blind, can't eat. Candy 
feeds him milk. He can't chew nothing else." 
 
 George had been staring intently at Slim. Suddenly a triangle

--- Chunk 8 ---
Candy looked about unhappily. "No," he said softly. "No, I 
couldn't do that. I had 'im too long." 
 
 "He don't have no fun," Carlson insisted. "And he stinks to beat 
hell. Tell you what. I'll shoot him for you. Then it won't be you 
that does it." 
 
 Candy threw his legs off his bunk. He scratched the white stubble 
whiskers on his check nervously. 
 
   
 
 "I'm so used to him," he said softly. "I had him from a pup."

--- Chunk 9 ---
Now Candy aroused himself. "Oh, George! I been figurin' and 
figurin'. I got it doped out how we can even make some money on 
them rabbits." 
 
 George scowled. "I thought I tol' you not to tell nobody about 
that." 
 
 Candy was crestfallen. "Didn't tell nobody but Crooks." 
 
 George said, "Well you guys get outta here. Jesus, seems like I 
can't go away for a minute." 
 
 Candy and Lennie stood up and went toward the door. Crooks 
called, "Candy!" 
 
 "Huh?"

Candy's words. "Oh, Jesus Christ!" He was down on his knees 
beside her.He put his hand over her heart. And finally, when he 
stood up, slowly and stify, his face was as hard and tight as wood, 
and his eyes were hard. 
 
 Candy said, "What done it?" 
 
 George looked coldly at him. "Ain't you got any idear?" he asked. 
And Candy was silent. "I should of knew," George said hopelessly. 
"I guess maybe way back in my head I did."

When George asks Slim about just trying to catch Lennie instead of killing him, what advice does Slim give George?

guy." 
 
 George spoke proudly. "Jus' tell Lennie what to do an' he'll do it if 
it don't take no figuring. He can't think of nothing to do himself, 
but he sure can take orders." 
 
 There was a clang of horseshoe on iron stake outside and a little 
cheer of voices. 
 
 Slim moved back slightly so the light was not on his face. "Funny 
how you an' him string along together." It was Slim's calm 
invitation to confidence. 
 
 "What's funny about it?" George demanded defensively.

all the time. 
 
 "Yeah, they get mean," Slim agreed. "They get so they don't want 
to talk to nobody." 
 
 "'Course Lennie's a God damn nuisance most of the time," said 
George. "But you get used to goin' around with a guy an' you can't

Lennie stuck out his hands. 
 
 "Christ awmighty, I hate to have you mad at me," Slim said. 
 
 George broke in, "Lennie was jus' scairt," he explained. "He didn't 
know what to do. I told you nobody ought never to fight him. No, I 
guess it was Candy I told." 
 
 Candy nodded solemnly. "That's jus' what you done," he said. 
"Right this morning when Curley first lit into your fren', you says, 
'He better not fool with Lennie if he knows what's good for 'um.'

--- Chunk 7 ---
"All right. But don’t try to put nothing over, ’cause you can’t get 
away with nothing. I seen wise guys before. Go on out with the 
grain teams after dinner. They’re pickin’ up barley at the 
threshing machine. Go out with Slim’s team." 
 
 "Slim?" 
 
 "Yeah. Big tall skinner. You’ll see him at dinner." He turned 
abruptly and went to the door, but before he went out he turned 
and looked for a long moment at the two men. 
 
 When the sound of his footsteps had died away George turned on

--- Chunk 8 ---
Slim came directly to George and sat down beside him, sat very 
close to him. "Never you mind," said Slim. "A guy got to 
sometimes." 
 
 But Carlson was standing over George. "How'd you do it?" he 
asked. 
 
 "I just done it," George said tiredly. 
 
 "Did he have my gun?" 
 
 "Yeah. He had your gun." 
 
 "An' you got it away from him and you took it an' you killed him?" 
 
 "Yeah. Tha's how." George's voice was almost a whisper. He

guys." He ran furiously out of the barn. Carlson said, "I'll get my 
Luger," and he ran out too. 
 
 Slim turned quietly to George. "I guess Lennie done it, all right," 
he said. "Her neck's bust. Lennie coulda did that." 
 
 George didn't answer, but he nodded slowly. His hat was so far 
down on his forehead that his eyes were covered. 
 
 Slim went on, "Maybe like that time in Weed you was tellin' 
about." 
 
 Again George nodded.

--- Chunk 10 ---
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George." 
 
 George got up and went over to Lennie's bunk and sat down on it. 
"I hate that kinda bastard," he said. "I seen plenty of 'em. Like the 
old guy says, Curley don't take no chances. He always wins." He 
thought for a moment. "If he tangles with you, Lennie, we're 
gonna get the can. Don't make no mistake about that. He's the 
boss's son. Look, Lennie. You try to keep away from him, will you?

 His voice grew soft and persuasive. "S'pose George don't come

 Lennie's attention came gradually to what had been said. "What?" 
he demanded. 
 
 "I said s'pose George went into town tonight and you never heard

But George sat stify on the bank and looked at his right hand 
that had thrown the gun away. The group burst into the clearing, 
and Curley was ahead. He saw Lennie lying on the sand. "Got

Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him

 "I’ll try to catch him," said Curley. His eyes passed over the new 
men and he stopped. He glanced coldly at George and then at 
Lennie. His arms gradually bene at the elbows and his hands 
closed into fists. He stiffened and went into a slight crouch. His 
glance was at once calculating and pugnacious. Lennie squirmed

the bunk watching him. 
 
 "Look, Lennie! This here ain't no set up. I'm scared. You gonna 
have trouble with that Curley guy. I seen that kind before. He was 
kinda feelin' you out. He figures he's got you scared and he's

 "Well, let him be handy," said George, "He don’t have to take after

Lennie?"

Curley came suddenly to life. "I know who done it," he cried. 
"That big son-of-a-bitch done it. I know he done it. Why-ever'body

fury. "I'm gonna get him. I'm going for my shotgun. I'll kill the big 
son-of-a-bitch myself. I'll shoot 'im in the guts. Come on, you

 Slim stood looking down at Curley's wife. He said, "Curley-maybe 
you better stay here with your wife." 
 
 Curley's face reddened. "I'm goin'," he said. "I'm gonna shoot the

"So that's what Curley picks for a wife." 
 
 "She's purty," said Lennie defensively. 
 
 "Yeah, and she's sure hidin' it. Curley got his work ahead of him. 
Bet she'd clear out for twenty bucks."

 She was a little bit reassured. "Well, who don't?" she said. 
"Ever'body likes that. I like to feel silk an' velvet. Do you like to

take the safe way." 
 
 She turned to Lennie. "I'm glad you bust up Curley a little bit. He

slipped out the door and disappeared into the dark barn. And

Lennie watched her, fascinated; but Candy and Crooks were 
scowling down away from her eyes. Candy said, "Then if you 
know, why you want to ast us where Curley is at?" 
 
 She regarded them amusedly. "Funny thing," she said. "If I catch

 THE deep green pool of the Salinas River was still in the late 
afternoon. Already the sun had left the valley to go climbing up 
the slopes of the Gabilan mountains, and the hilltops were rosy in 
the sun. But by the pool among the mottled sycamores, a pleasant 
shade had fallen. 
 
 A water snake glided smoothly up the pool, twist-ing its periscope 
head from side to side; and it swam the length of the pool and

came fast. On the wind the sound of crashing in the brush came to 
them.

 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the 
darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," 
George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of 
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined.

frightened voice. "Maybe George come back already. Maybe I 
better go see." 
 
 Crooks said, "I didn't mean to scare you. He'll come back. I was

--- Chunk 9 ---
"George ain't hurt. He's all right. He'll be back all right." 
 
 Lennie stood over him. "What you supposin' for? Ain't nobody 
goin' to suppose no hurt to George." 
 
 Crooks removed his glasses and wiped his eyes with his fingers. 
"Jus' set down," he said. "George ain't hurt." 
 
 Lennie growled back to his seat on the nail keg. "Ain't nobody 
goin' to talk no hurt to George," he grumbled. 
 
 Crooks said gently, "Maybe you can see now. You got George.

--- Chunk 10 ---
somebody's out there," Crooks said. "Maybe Slim. Slim comes in 
sometimes two, three times a night. Slim's a real skinner. He 
looks out for his team." He pulled himself painfully upright and 
moved toward the door. "That you, Slim?" he called. 
 
 Candy's voice answered. "Slim went in town. Say, you seen 
Lennie?" 
 
 "Ya mean the big guy?" 
 
 "Yeah. Seen him around any place?" 
 
 "He's in here," Crooks said shortly. He went back to his bunk and 
lay down.


=== Question 56 ===
How is George and Lennie's conversation similar to the one that they had by the pool in Chapter 1?

--- Chunk 1 ---
"Oh, so it’s that way." 
 
 George was tense, and motionless. "Yeah, it’s that way." 
 
 Lennie was looking helplessly to George for instruction. 
 
 "An’ yon won’t let the big guy talk, is that it?" 
 
 "He can talk if he wants to tell you anything." He nodded slightly 
to Lennie. 
 
 "We jus’ come in," said Lennie softly. 
 
 Curley stared levelly at him. "Well, nex’ time you answer when 
you’re spoke to." He turned toward the door and walked out, and

 Curley stared levelly at him. "Well, nex’ time you answer when

--- Chunk 4 ---
was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so 
you can almost see it." 
 
 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the 
darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," 
George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of 
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined.

so the water arose in little splashes; rings widened across the pool 
to the other side and came back again. Lennie watched them go. 
"Look, George. Look what I done." 
 
 George knelt beside the pool and drank from his hand with quick 
scoops. "Tastes all right," he admitted. "Don’t really seem to be 
running, though. You never oughta drink water when it ain’t 
running, Lennie," he said hopelessly. "You’d drink out of a gutter

--- Chunk 7 ---
"Tell you what?" 
 
 "About the rabbits." 
 
 George snapped, "You ain’t gonna put nothing over on me." 
 
 Lennie pleads "Come on, George. Tell me. Please, George. Like 
you done before." 
 
 "You get a kick outta that, don’t you? Awright, I’ll tell you, and 
then we’ll eat our supper...." 
 
 George’s voice became deeper. He repeated his words 
rhythmically as though he had said them many times before. 
"Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the

--- Chunk 8 ---
George was quiet for a moment. "But not us," he said. 
 
   
 
 "Because-" 
 
 "Because I got you an'' 
 
 "An' I got you. We got each other, that's what, that gives a hoot in 
hell about us," Lennie cried in triumph. 
 
 The little evening breeze blew over the clearing and the leaves 
rustled and the wind waves flowed up the green pool. And the 
shouts of men sounded again, this time much closer than before. 
 
 George took off his hat. He said shakily, "Take off your hat,

--- Chunk 9 ---
Lennie giggled happily. "I didn’t forget that, you bet." 
 
 George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his 
head, and Lennie imitated him, raising his head to see whether he 
were doing it right. "God, you’re a lot of trouble," said George. "I 
could get along so easy and so nice if I didn’t have you on my tail. I 
could live so easy and maybe have a girl." 
 
 For a moment Lennie lay quiet, and then he said hopefully, "We 
gonna work on a ranch, George."

--- Chunk 10 ---
Lennie, who had been following the conversation back and forth 
with his eyes, smiled complacency at the compliment. Slim looked 
approvingly at George for having given the compliment. He leaned 
over the table and snapped the corner of a loose card. "You guys 
travel around together?" His tone was friendly. It invited 
confidence without demanding it. 
 
 "Sure," said George. "We kinda look after each other." He 
indicated Lennie with his thumb. "He ain't bright. Hell of a good

But George sat stify on the bank and looked at his right hand 
that had thrown the gun away. The group burst into the clearing, 
and Curley was ahead. He saw Lennie lying on the sand. "Got 
him, by God." He went over and looked down at Lennie, and then 
he looked back at George. "Right in the back of the head," he said 
softly.

hand. He put an ace up on his scoring rack and piled a two, three 
and four of diamonds on it. "Andy's in San Quentin right now on 
account of a tart," said George. 
 
 Lennie drummed on the table with his fingers. "George?" 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "George, how long's it gonna be till we get that little place an' live 
on the fatta the lan-an' rabbits?"

trigger. The crash of the shot rolled up the hills and rolled down 
again. Lennie jarred, and then settled slowly forward to the sand, 
and he lay without quivering. 
 
 George shivered and looked at the gun, and then he threw it from 
him, back up on the bank, near the pile of old ashes. 
 
 The brush seemed filled with cries and with the sound of running 
feet. Slim's voice shouted, "George. Where you at, George?" 
 
 But George sat stify on the bank and looked at his right hand

pocket." His hand went into the pocket again. 
 
 George looked sharply at him. "What’d you take outa that 
pocket?" 
 
 "Ain’t a thing in my pocket," Lennie said cleverly. 
 
 "I know there ain’t. You got it in your hand. What you got in your

could keep it. Nobody’d take it away from me." 
 
 George looked quickly and searchingly at him. "I been mean, ain’t 
I?" 
 
 "If you don’ want me I can go off in the hills an’ find a cave. I can 
go away any time." 
 
 "No - look! I was jus’ foolin’, Lennie. ’Cause'. I want you to stay 
with me. Trouble with mice is you always kill ’em." He paused. 
"Tell you what I’ll do, Lennie. First chance I get I'll give you a pup. 
Maybe you wouldn’t killit. That’d be better than. mice. And you

Slim came directly to George and sat down beside him, sat very 
close to him. "Never you mind," said Slim. "A guy got to 
sometimes." 
 
 But Carlson was standing over George. "How'd you do it?" he 
asked. 
 
 "I just done it," George said tiredly. 
 
 "Did he have my gun?" 
 
 "Yeah. He had your gun." 
 
 "An' you got it away from him and you took it an' you killed him?" 
 
 "Yeah. Tha's how." George's voice was almost a whisper. He

"He won't do it," Lennie cried. "George wouldn't do nothing like 
that. I been with George a long time. He'll come back tonight-" But 
the doubt was too much for him. "Don't you think he will?" 
 
 Crooks' face lighted with pleasure in his torture. 
 
 "Nobody can't tell what a guy'll do," he observed calmly. "Le's say 
he wants to come back and can't. S'pose he gets killed or hurt so

 His voice grew soft and persuasive. "S'pose George don't come 
back no more. S'pose he took a powder and just ain't coming back. 
What'll you do then?" 
 
 Lennie's attention came gradually to what had been said. "What?" 
he demanded. 
 
 "I said s'pose George went into town tonight and you never heard 
of him no more." Crooks pressed forward some kind of private 
victory. "Just s'pose that," he repeated. 
 
 "He won't do it," Lennie cried. "George wouldn't do nothing like

guy. You seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?" 
 
 "Sure," said George. "I seen plenty tough little guys. But this

Lennie." 
 
 "Sure I will, George. I won't say a word." 
 
 "Don't let him pull you in-but-if the son-of-abitch socks you-let 'im 
have it." 
 
 "Let 'im have what, George?" 
 
 "Never mind, never mind. I'll tell you when. I hate that kind of a 
guy. Look, Lennie, if you get in any kind of trouble, you remember 
what I told you to do?" 
 
 Lennie raised up on his elbow. His face contorted with thought.

--- Chunk 10 ---
Maybe you wouldn’t killit. That’d be better than. mice. And you 
could pet it harder." 
 
 Lennie avoided the bait. He had sensed his advantage, "If you 
don’t want me, you only jus’ got to say so, and I’ll go off in those 
hills right there - right up in those hills and live by myself. An’ I 
won’t get no mice stole from me." 
 
 George said, "I want you to stay with me, Lennie. Jesus Christ,

the corners of the bunk house still in dusk. Slim sat down on a box 
and George took his place opposite.

George had been staring intently at Slim. Suddenly a triangle

until the beat of it disappeared into one ringing sound. It stopped 
as suddenly as it had started.

 Outside, there was a burst of voices as a group of men went by.

 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the

George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of

Slim smiled wryly. He knelt down beside Curley. "You got your
