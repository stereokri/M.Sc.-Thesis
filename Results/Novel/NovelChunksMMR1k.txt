=== Question 1 ===
When George and Lennie approach the river, why does George warn Lennie not to drink too much water?

--- Chunk 1 ---
so the water arose in little splashes; rings widened across the pool 
to the other side and came back again. Lennie watched them go. 
"Look, George. Look what I done." 
 
 George knelt beside the pool and drank from his hand with quick 
scoops. "Tastes all right," he admitted. "Don’t really seem to be 
running, though. You never oughta drink water when it ain’t 
running, Lennie," he said hopelessly. "You’d drink out of a gutter 
if you was thirsty." He threw a scoop of water into his face and 
rubbed it about with his hand, under his chin and around the back 
of his neck. Then he replaced his hat, pushed himself back from 
the river, drew up his knees and embraced them. Lennie, who had 
been watching, imitated George exactly. He pushed himself back, 
drew up his knees, embraced them, looked over to George to see 
whether he had it just right. He pulled his hat down a little more 
over his eyes, the way George’s hat was.

 "O.K.- O.K. I’ll tell ya again. I ain’t got nothing to do. Might jus’ 
as well spen’ all my time tellin’ you things and then you forget 
’em, and I tell you again." 
 
 "Tried and tried," said Lennie, "but it didn’t do no good. I

 "The hell with the rabbits. That’s all you ever can remember is

"Yeah, what ya want?" 
 
 "Where we goin’, George?" 
 
 The little man jerked down the brim of his hat and scowled over 
at Lennie. "So yon forgot that awready, did you? I gotta tell you 
again, do I? Jesus Christ, you’re a crazy bastard!" 
 
 "I forgot," Lennie said softly. "I tried not to forget. Honest to God I


=== Question 3 ===
Why does Lennie have a dead mouse in his pocket?

--- Chunk 1 ---
"Give ithere!" 
 
 Lennie’s closed hand slowly obeyed. George took the mouse and 
threw it across the pool to the other side, among the brush. "What 
you want of a dead mouse, anyways?" 
 
 "I could pet it with my thumb while we walked along," said 
Lennie. 
 
 "Well, you ain’t petting no mice while you walk with me. You 
remember where we’re goin’ now?" 
 
 Lennie looked startled and then in embarrassment hid his face 
against his knees. "I forgot again."

--- Chunk 5 ---
puttin’ nothing over." 
 
 Lennie hesitated, backed away, looked wildly at the brush line as 
though he contemplated running for his freedom. George said 
coldly, "You gonna give me that mouse or do I have to sock you?" 
 
 "Give you what, George?" 
 
 "You know God damn well what. I want that mouse." 
 
 Lennie reluctantly reached into his pocket. His voice broke a 
little. "I don’t know why I can’t keep it. It ain’t nobody’s mouse. I 
didn’t steal it. I found it lyin’ right beside the road."


=== Question 4 ===
Why does George order Lennie not to talk when they get to the ranch?

--- Chunk 1 ---
"Tell you what?" 
 
 "About the rabbits." 
 
 George snapped, "You ain’t gonna put nothing over on me." 
 
 Lennie pleads "Come on, George. Tell me. Please, George. Like 
you done before." 
 
 "You get a kick outta that, don’t you? Awright, I’ll tell you, and 
then we’ll eat our supper...." 
 
 George’s voice became deeper. He repeated his words 
rhythmically as though he had said them many times before.

to a ranch an’ work up a stake and then they go inta town and 
blow their stake, and the first thing you know they’re poundin’ 
their tail on some other ranch. They ain’t got nothing to look 
ahead to." 
 
 Lennie was delighted. "That’s it - that’s it. Now tell how it is with 
us." 
 
 George went on. "With us it ain’t like that. We got a future. We 
got somebody to talk to that gives a damn about us. We don’t have

--- Chunk 5 ---
"You never seen Slim talkin' to her?" 
 
 "Uh-uh. She ain't been in the barn." 
 
 "O.K.," said George. "I guess them guys ain't gonna see no fight. If 
there's any fightin', Lennie, you keep out of it." 
 
 "I don't want no fights," said Lennie. He got up from his bunk and

What happened to all of the mice that Lennie's Aunt Clara gave him?

--- Chunk 1 ---
don’t know where there is no other mouse. I remember a lady used 
to give ’em to me - ever’ one she got. But that lady ain’t here." 
 
 George scoffed. "Lady, huh? Don’t even remember who that lady 
was. That was your own Aunt Clara. An’ she stopped givin’ ’em to 
ya. You always killed ’em." 
 
 Lennie looked sadly up at him. "They was so little," he said, 
apologetically. "I’d pet ’em, and pretty soon they bit my fingers 
and I pinched their heads a little and then they was dead -

 Lennie looked sadly up at him. "They was so little," he said, 
apologetically. "I’d pet ’em, and pretty soon they bit my fingers 
and I pinched their heads a little and then they was dead - 
because they was so little. 
 
 "I wish’t we’d get the rabbits pretty soon, George. They ain’t so 
little." 
 
 "The hell with the rabbits. An’ you ain’t to be trusted with no live 
mice; Your Aunt Clara give you a rubber mouse and you wouldn’t 
have nothing to do with it." 
 
 "It wasn’t no good to pet," said Lennie. 
 
 The flame of the sunset lifted from the mountain-tops and dusk 
came into the valley, and a half darkness came in among the


=== Question 6 ===
Why have George and Lennie run away from Weed?

--- Chunk 1 ---
"O.K.," said George. "An’ you ain’t gonna do no bad things like you 
done in Weed, neither." 
 
 Lennie looked puzzled. "Like I done in Weed?" 
 
 "Oh, so ya forgot that too, did ya. Well, I ain’t gonna remind ya, 
fear ya do it again." 
 
 A light of understanding broke on Lennie’s face. "They run us 
outa Weed," he exploded triumphantly. 
 
 "Run us out, hell," said George disgustedly. "We run. They was 
lookin’ for us, but they didn’t catch us.

Luger," and he ran out too. 
 
 Slim turned quietly to George. "I guess Lennie done it, all right," 
he said. "Her neck's bust. Lennie coulda did that." 
 
 George didn't answer, but he nodded slowly. His hat was so far 
down on his forehead that his eyes were covered. 
 
 Slim went on, "Maybe like that time in Weed you was tellin' 
about." 
 
 Again George nodded.

=== Question 7 ===
What does Lennie want to eat with his beans?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Nuts!" He took out his pocket knife. "I ain’t got time for no more." 
He drove his knife through the top of one of the bean cans, sawed 
out the top and passed the can to Lennie. Then he opened a second 
can. From his side pocket he brought out two spoons and passed 
one of them to Lennie. 
 
 They sat by the fire and filled their mouths with beans and 
chewed mightily. A few beans slipped out of the side of Lennie’s 
mouth. George gestured with his spoon. "What you gonna say 
tomorrow when the boss asks you questions?" 
 
 Lennie stopped chewing and swallowed. His face was 
concentrated. "I.... I ain’t gonna.... say a word." 
 
 "Good boy! That’s fine, Lennie! Maybe you’re gettin’ better. When 
we get the coupla acres I can let you tend the rabbits all right. 
’Specially if you remember as good as that."

=== Question 8 ===
Why does George say that migrant workers who travel from farm to farm are the loneliest people in the world?

--- Chunk 1 ---
"Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the 
world. They got no family. They don’t belong no place. They come 
to a ranch an’ work up a stake and then they go inta town and 
blow their stake, and the first thing you know they’re poundin’

"Oh, I dunno. Hardly none of the guys ever travel together. I 
hardly never seen two guys travel together. You know how the 
hands are, they just come in and get their bunk and work a 
month, and then they quit and go out alone. Never seem to give a 
damn about nobody. It jus' seems kinda funny a cuckoo like him 
and a smart little guy like you travelin' together." 
 
 "He ain't no cuckoo," said George. "He's dumb as hell, but he ain't 
crazy. An' I ain't so bright neither, or I wouldn't be buckin' barley 
for my fifty and found. If I was bright, if I was even a little bit 
smart, I'd have my own little place, an' I'd be bringin' in my own 
crops, 'stead of doin' all the work and not getting what comes up 
outa the ground." George fell silent. He wanted to talk. Slim 
neither encouraged nor discouraged him. He just sat back quiet 
and receptive.

What dream do George and Lennie share?

Lennie giggled happily. "I didn’t forget that, you bet." 
 
 George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his 
head, and Lennie imitated him, raising his head to see whether he 
were doing it right. "God, you’re a lot of trouble," said George. "I 
could get along so easy and so nice if I didn’t have you on my tail. I 
could live so easy and maybe have a girl." 
 
 For a moment Lennie lay quiet, and then he said hopefully, "We

at last. "Him and me was both born in Auburn. I knowed his Aunt

his Aunt Clara died, Lennie just come along with me out workin'. 
Got kinda used to each other after a little while."

fastened on him. "Funny," said George. "I used to have a hell of a

 Lennie leaned toward the old swamper "About them rabbits," he 
insisted. 
 
 Candy smiled. "I got it figured out. We can make some money on 
them rabbits if we go about it right."

"How’d you like the boss?" he asked. 
 
 "Pretty good. Seemed awright." 
 
 "He’s a nice fella," the swamper agreed. "You got to take him

 At that moment a young man came into the bunk house; a thin 
young man with a brown face, with brown eyes and a head of 
tightly curled hair. He wore a work glove on his left hand, and, 
like the boss, he wore high-heeled boots, "Seen my old man?" he 
asked.

 The swamper said, "He was here jus’ a minute ago, Curley. Went 
over to the cook house, I think." 
 
 "I’ll try to catch him," said Curley. His eyes passed over the new 
men and he stopped. He glanced coldly at George and then at 
Lennie. His arms gradually bene at the elbows and his hands 
closed into fists. He stiffened and went into a slight crouch. His 
glance was at once calculating and pugnacious. Lennie squirmed 
under the look and shifted his feet nervously. Curley stepped 
gingerly close to him. "You the new guys the old man was waitin' 
for?"

 "You get a kick outta that, don’t you? Awright, I’ll tell you, and

According to George, how did he end up traveling with Lennie?

Lennie giggled happily. "I didn’t forget that, you bet." 
 
 George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his 
head, and Lennie imitated him, raising his head to see whether he 
were doing it right. "God, you’re a lot of trouble," said George. "I 
could get along so easy and so nice if I didn’t have you on my tail. I 
could live so easy and maybe have a girl."

"O.K.," said George. "An’ you ain’t gonna do no bad things like you

 Lennie looked puzzled. "Like I done in Weed?" 
 
 "Oh, so ya forgot that too, did ya. Well, I ain’t gonna remind ya, 
fear ya do it again." 
 
 A light of understanding broke on Lennie’s face. "They run us

 "Run us out, hell," said George disgustedly. "We run. They was 
lookin’ for us, but they didn’t catch us.

 Slim turned quietly to George. "I guess Lennie done it, all right," 
he said. "Her neck's bust. Lennie coulda did that." 
 
 George didn't answer, but he nodded slowly. His hat was so far

=== Question 25 ===
Who makes the final decision on whether or not Candy's old dog should be shot?

--- Chunk 1 ---
During the conversation Carlson had refused to be drawn in. He 
continued to look down at the old dog. Candy watched him 
uneasily. At last Carlson said, "if you want me to, I'll put the old 
devil out of his misery right now and get it over with. Ain't 
nothing left for him. Can't eat, can't see, can't even walk without 
hurtin'." 
 
 Candy said hopefully, "You ain't got no gun." 
 
 "The hell I ain't. Got a Luger. It won't hurt him none at all."

Candy looked about unhappily. "No," he said softly. "No, I 
couldn't do that. I had 'im too long." 
 
 "He don't have no fun," Carlson insisted. "And he stinks to beat 
hell. Tell you what. I'll shoot him for you. Then it won't be you 
that does it." 
 
 Candy threw his legs off his bunk. He scratched the white stubble 
whiskers on his check nervously. 
 
   
 
 "I'm so used to him," he said softly. "I had him from a pup." 
 
 "Well, you ain't bein' kind to him keepin' him alive," said Carlson. 
"Look, Slim's bitch got a litter right now. I bet Slim would give you 
one of them pnps to raise up, wouldn't you, Slim?" 
 
 The skinner had been studying the old dog with his calm eyes. 
"Yeah," he said. "You can have a pup if you want to." He seemed to 
shake himself free for speech. "Carl's right, Candy. That dog ain't 
no good to himself. I wisht somebody'd shoot me if I get old an' a 
cripple." 
 
 Candy looked helplessly at him, for Slim's opinions were law.

 George raised the gun and his hands shook, and he dropped his

 "Go on," said Lennie. "How's it gonna be. We gonna get a little

 "We'll have a cow," said George. "An' we'll have maybe a pig an'

 "Yes." 
 
 Lennie turned his head. 
 
 "No, Lennie. Look down there acrost the river, like you can 
almost see the place." 
 
 Lennie obeyed him. George looked down at the gun. 
 
 There were crashing footsteps in the brush now. George turned

Why does George agree to let Candy come with them to their dream farm?

popped into the future when this lovely thing should come about. 
 
 George said wonderingly, "S'pose they was a carnival or a circus

nodded in appreciation of the idea. "We'd just go to her," George 
said. "We wouldn't ask nobody if we could. Jus' say, 'We'll go to

 George said softly, "-I think I knowed from the very first I think I

Why has Crooks been able to accumulate more personal items than the other ranch hands?

with the horsehairstuffing sticking out, a broken hame, and a 
trace chain with its leather covering split. Crooks had his apple 
box over his bunk, and in it a range of medicine bottles, both for 
himself and for the horses. There were cans of saddle soap and a 
drippy can of tar with its paint brush sticking over the edge. And 
scattered about the floor were a number of personal possessions; 
for, being alone, Crooks could leave his things about, and being a 
stable buck and a cripple, he was more permanent than the other

--- Chunk 2 ---
men, and he had accumulated more possessions than he could 
carry on his back. 
 
 Crooks possessed several pairs of shoes, a pair of rubber boots, a 
big alarm clock and a single-barreled shotgun. And he had books, 
too; a tattered dictionary and a mauled copy of the California civil 
code for 1905. There were battered magazines and a few dirty 
books on a special shelf over his bunk. A pair of large gold-rimmed 
spectacles hung from a nail on the wall above his bed. 
 
 This room was swept and fairly neat, for Crooks was a proud, 
aloof man. He kept his distance and demanded that other people 
keep theirs. His body was bent over to the left by his crooked 
spine, and his eyes lay deep in his head, and because of their 
depth seemed to glitter with intensity. His lean face was lined 
with deep black wrinkles, and he had thin, pain-tightened lips 
which were lighter than his face. 
 
 It was Saturday night. Through the open door that led into the

 "Yeah?" said Crooks. "An' where's George now? In town in a 
whore house. That's where your money's goin'. Jesus, I seen it 
happen too many times. I seen too many guys with land in their

Candy cried, "Sure they all want it. Everybody wants a little bit of 
land, not much. Jus' som'thin' that was his. Som'thin' he could live 
on and there couldn't nobody throw him off of it. I never had none. 
I planted crops for damn near ever'body in this state, but they 
wasn't my crops, and when I harvested 'em, it wasn't none of any 
harvest. But we gonna do it now, and don't you make no mistake 
about that. George ain't got the money in town. That money's in 
the bank. Me an' Lennie an' George. We gonna have a room to 
ourself. We're gonna have a dog an' rabbits an' chickens. We're 
gonna have green corn an' maybe a cow or a goat." He stopped, 
overwhelmed with his picture. 
 
 Crooks asked, "You say you got the money?" 
 
 "Damn right. We got most of it. Just a little bit more to get. Have 
it all in one month. George got the land all picked out, too." 
 
 Crooks reached around and explored his spine with his hand. "I

ast George." 
 
 Crooks put his dark chin into his pink palm. "You travel aroun' 
with George, don't ya?" 
 
 "Sure. Me an' him goes ever' place together." 
 
 Crooks continued. "Sometimes he talks, and you don't know what 
the hell he's talkin' about. Ain't that so?" He leaned forward, 
boring Lennie with his deep eyes. "Ain't that so?" 
 
 "Yeah . . . . sometimes." 
 
 "Jus' talks on, an' you don't know what the hell it's all about?" 
 
 "Yeah . . . . sometimes. But . . . . not always." 
 
 Crooks leaned forward over the edge of the bunk. "I ain't a 
Southern Negro," he said." I was born right bere in California. My 
old man had a chicken ranch, 'bout ten acres. The white kids come 
to play at our place, an' sometimes I event to play with them, and 
some of them was pretty nice. My of man didn't like that. I never 
knew till long later why he didn't like that. But I know now." He

 "'Cause I'm black. They play cards in there, but I can't play 
because I'm black. They say I stink. Well, I tell you, you all of you 
stink to me." 
 
 Lennie flapped his big hands helplessly. "Ever'body went into

 "Well, what do you want?"

Candy quickly changed the subject. "Slim's as good a skinner as I

 Lennie leaned toward the old swamper "About them rabbits," he 
insisted.

Lennie watched her, fascinated; but Candy and Crooks were 
scowling down away from her eyes. Candy said, "Then if you 
know, why you want to ast us where Curley is at?" 
 
 She regarded them amusedly. "Funny thing," she said. "If I catch 
any one man, and he's alone, I get along fine with him. But just let

got to thinking maybe we would." 
 
 "Then-it's all off?" Candy said sulkily.

 In a second George stood framed in the door, and he looked 
disapprovingly about. "What you doin' in Crooks' room? You 
hadn't ought to lie here." 
 
 Crooks nodded "I tol' 'em, but they come in anyways." 
 
 "Well, why'n't you kick'em out?"

George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun

 Slim turned quietly to George. "I guess Lennie done it, all right," 
he said. "Her neck's bust. Lennie coulda did that." 
 
 George didn't answer, but he nodded slowly. His hat was so far

 George looked around at Lennie. "Jesus, what a tramp," he said. 
"So that's what Curley picks for a wife." 
 
 "She's purty," said Lennie defensively. 
 
 "Yeah, and she's sure hidin' it. Curley got his work ahead of him. 
Bet she'd clear out for twenty bucks." 
 
 Lennie still stared at the doorway where she had been. "Gosh, she 
was purty." He smiled admiringly. George looked quickly down at 
him and then he took him by an ear and shook him.

George moved slowly after them, and his feet dragged heavily. 
 
 And when they were gone, Candy squatted down in the hay and 
watched the face of Curley's wife. "Poor bastard," he said softly. 
 
 The sound of the men grew fainter. The barn was darkening 
gradually and, in their stalls, the horses shifted their feet and 
rattled the halter chains. Old Candy lay down in the hay and 
covered his eyes with his arm.

pitchers took of me. When they had them previews I coulda went 
to them, an' spoke in the radio, an' it wouldn'ta cost me a cent 
because I was in the pitcher. An' all them nice clothes like they 
wear. Because this guy says I was a natural." She looked up at 
Lennie, and she made a small grand gesture with her arm and 
hand to show that she could act. The fingers trailed after her 
leading wrist, and her little finger stuck out grandly from the rest. 
 
 Lennie sighed deeply. From outside came the clang of a horseshoe 
on metal, and then a chorus of cheers. "Somebody made a ringer," 
said Curley's wife. 
 
 Now the light was lifting as the sun went down, and the sun 
streaks climbed up the wall and fell over the feeding racks and 
over the heads of the horses. 
 
 Lennie said, "Maybe if I took this pup out and throwed him away 
George wouldn't never know: An' then I could tend the rabbits 
without n

--- Chunk 2 ---
Curley's fist was swinging when Lennie reached for it. The next 
minute Curley was flopping like a fish on a line, and his closed fist 
was lost in Lennie's big hand. George ran down the room. "Leggo 
of him, Lennie. Let go." 
 
   
 
 But Lennie watched in terror the flopping little man whom he 
held. Blood ran down Lennie's face; one of his eyes was cut and 
closed. George slapped him in the face again and again, and still 
Lennie held on to the closed fist. Curley was white and shrunken; 
by now, and his struggling had become weak. He stood crying, his 
fist lost in Lennie's paw. 
 
 George shouted over and over, "Leggo his hand, Lennie. Leggo. 
Slim, come help me while the guy got any hand left." 
 
 Suddenly Lennie let go his hold. He crouch cowering against the 
wall. "You tol' me to, George," he said miserably. 
 
 Curley sat down on the floor, looking in wonder at his crushed 
hand. Slim and Carlson bent over him. Then Slim straightened up

--- Chunk 3 ---
and jumped in among the puppies. 
 
 Curley's wife lay with a half-covering of yellow hay. And the 
meanness and the plannings and the discontent and the ache for 
attention were all gone from her face. She was very pretty and 
simple, and her face was sweet and young. Now her rouged cheeks 
and her reddened lips made her seem alive and sleeping very 
lightly. The curls, tiny little sausages, were spread on the hay 
behind her head, and her lips were parted. 
 
 As happens sometimes, a moment settled and hovered and 
remained for much more than a moment. And sound stopped and 
movement stopped for much, much more than a moment. 
 
 Then gradually time awakened again and moved sluggishly on. 
The horses stamped on the other side of the feeding racks and the 
halter chains clinked. Outside, the men's voices became louder 
and clearer. 
 
 From around the end of the last stall old Candy's voice came. 
"Lennie," he called. "Oh, Lennie! You in here? 1 been figuring

horseshoe game. And then he crept around the end of the last 
manger and disappeared. 
 
 The sun streaks were high on the wall by now, and the light was 
growing soft in the barn. Curley's wife lay on her back, and she 
was half covered with hay. 
 
 It was very quiet in the barn, and the quiet of the afternoon was 
on the ranch. Even the clang of the pitched shoes, even the voices 
of the men in the game seemed to grow more quiet. The air in the 
barn was dusky in advance of the outside day. A pigeon flew in 
through the open hay door and circled and flew out again. Around 
the last stall came a shepherd bitch, lean and long, with heavy, 
hanging dugs. Halfway to the packing box where the puppies were 
she caught the dead scent of Curley's wife, and the hair arose 
along her spine. She whimpered and cringed to the packing box, 
and jumped in among the puppies. 
 
 Curley's wife lay with a half-covering of yellow hay. And the

 CHAPTER  4 
 
   
 
 CROOKS, the Negro stable buck, had his bunk in the harness 
room; a little shed that leaned off the wall of the barn. On one side 
of the little room there was a square four-paned window, and on 
the other, a narrow plank door leading into the barn. Crooks' bunk 
was a long box filled with straw, on which his blankets were flung. 
On the wall by the window there were pegs on which hung broken 
harness in process of being mended; strips of new leather; and 
under the window itself a little bench for leatherworking tools, 
curved knives and needles and balls of linen thread, and a small 
hand riveter. On pegs were also pieces of harness, a split collar 
with the horsehairstuffing sticking out, a broken hame, and a

George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun

to keep up. George continued, "You remember Andy Cushman, 
Lennie? Went to grammar school?" 
 
 "The one that his old lady used to make hot cakes for the kids?" 
Lennie asked. 
 
 "Yeah. That's the one. You can remember anything if there's

so the water arose in little splashes; rings widened across the pool 
to the other side and came back again. Lennie watched them go. 
"Look, George. Look what I done." 
 
 George knelt beside the pool and drank from his hand with quick 
scoops. "Tastes all right," he admitted. "Don’t really seem to be 
running, though. You never oughta drink water when it ain’t 
running, Lennie," he said hopelessly. "You’d drink out of a gutter 
if you was thirsty." He threw a scoop of water into his face and 
rubbed it about with his hand, under his chin and around the back 
of his neck. Then he replaced his hat, pushed himself back from 
the river, drew up his knees and embraced them. Lennie, who had 
been watching, imitated George exactly. He pushed himself back, 
drew up his knees, embraced them, looked over to George to see 
whether he had it just right. He pulled his hat down a little more 
over his eyes, the way George’s hat was.

electric light. Instantly the table was brilliant with light, and the 
cone of the shade threw its brightness straight downward, leaving 
the corners of the bunk house still in dusk. Slim sat down on a box 
and George took his place opposite. 
 
 "It wasn't nothing," said Slim. "I would of had to drowned most of 
'em anyways. No need to thank me about that." 
 
 George said, "It wasn't much to you, maybe, but it was a hell of a

 George let himself be helped to his feet. "Yeah, a drink." 
 
 Slim said, "You hadda, George. I swear you had-da. Come on with

the highway. 
 
 Curley and Carlson looked after them. And Carlson said, "Now 
what the hell ya suppose is eatin' them two guys?"
