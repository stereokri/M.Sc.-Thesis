When George and Lennie approach the river, why does George warn Lennie not to drink too much water?

--- Chunk 1 ---
so the water arose in little splashes; rings widened across the pool 
to the other side and came back again. Lennie watched them go. 
"Look, George. Look what I done." 
 
 George knelt beside the pool and drank from his hand with quick 
scoops. "Tastes all right," he admitted. "Don’t really seem to be 
running, though. You never oughta drink water when it ain’t 
running, Lennie," he said hopelessly. "You’d drink out of a gutter 
if you was thirsty." He threw a scoop of water into his face and 
rubbed it about with his hand, under his chin and around the back 
of his neck. Then he replaced his hat, pushed himself back from 
the river, drew up his knees and embraced them. Lennie, who had 
been watching, imitated George exactly. He pushed himself back, 
drew up his knees, embraced them, looked over to George to see 
whether he had it just right. He pulled his hat down a little more 
over his eyes, the way George’s hat was.

 "Where we goin’, George?" 
 
 The little man jerked down the brim of his hat and scowled over

=== Question 3 ===
Why does Lennie have a dead mouse in his pocket?

--- Chunk 1 ---
"Give ithere!" 
 
 Lennie’s closed hand slowly obeyed. George took the mouse and 
threw it across the pool to the other side, among the brush. "What 
you want of a dead mouse, anyways?" 
 
 "I could pet it with my thumb while we walked along," said 
Lennie. 
 
 "Well, you ain’t petting no mice while you walk with me. You 
remember where we’re goin’ now?" 
 
 Lennie looked startled and then in embarrassment hid his face 
against his knees. "I forgot again."

work on a ranch like the one we come from up north" 
 
 "Up north?" 
 


--- Chunk 6 ---
puttin’ nothing over." 
 
 Lennie hesitated, backed away, looked wildly at the brush line as 
though he contemplated running for his freedom. George said 
coldly, "You gonna give me that mouse or do I have to sock you?" 
 
 "Give you what, George?" 
 
 "You know God damn well what. I want that mouse." 
 
 Lennie reluctantly reached into his pocket. His voice broke a 
little. "I don’t know why I can’t keep it. It ain’t nobody’s mouse. I 
didn’t steal it. I found it lyin’ right beside the road."

=== Question 4 ===
Why does George order Lennie not to talk when they get to the ranch?

--- Chunk 1 ---
"Tell you what?" 
 
 "About the rabbits." 
 
 George snapped, "You ain’t gonna put nothing over on me." 
 
 Lennie pleads "Come on, George. Tell me. Please, George. Like 
you done before." 
 
 "You get a kick outta that, don’t you? Awright, I’ll tell you, and 
then we’ll eat our supper...."

blow their stake, and the first thing you know they’re poundin’ 
their tail on some other ranch. They ain’t got nothing to look

 George scoffed. "Lady, huh? Don’t even remember who that lady

ya. You always killed ’em." 
 
 Lennie looked sadly up at him. "They was so little," he said,

 Slim turned quietly to George. "I guess Lennie done it, all right," 
he said. "Her neck's bust. Lennie coulda did that." 
 
 George didn't answer, but he nodded slowly. His hat was so far 
down on his forehead that his eyes were covered.

=== Question 7 ===
What does Lennie want to eat with his beans?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Nuts!" He took out his pocket knife. "I ain’t got time for no more." 
He drove his knife through the top of one of the bean cans, sawed 
out the top and passed the can to Lennie. Then he opened a second 
can. From his side pocket he brought out two spoons and passed 
one of them to Lennie. 
 
 They sat by the fire and filled their mouths with beans and 
chewed mightily. A few beans slipped out of the side of Lennie’s

He drove his knife through the top of one of the bean cans, sawed 
out the top and passed the can to Lennie. Then he opened a second 
can. From his side pocket he brought out two spoons and passed 
one of them to Lennie.

Why does George say that migrant workers who travel from farm to farm are the loneliest people in the world?

"Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the

to a ranch an’ work up a stake and then they go inta town and 
blow their stake, and the first thing you know they’re poundin’ 
their tail on some other ranch. They ain’t got nothing to look

hardly never seen two guys travel together. You know how the

and a smart little guy like you travelin' together." 
 
 "He ain't no cuckoo," said George. "He's dumb as hell, but he ain't 
crazy. An' I ain't so bright neither, or I wouldn't be buckin' barley

 Lennie giggled happily. "I didn’t forget that, you bet." 
 
 George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his 
head, and Lennie imitated him, raising his head to see whether he 
were doing it right. "God, you’re a lot of trouble," said George. "I 
could get along so easy and so nice if I didn’t have you on my tail. I

held. Blood ran down Lennie's face; one of his eyes was cut and 
closed. George slapped him in the face again and again, and still

Curley's fist was swinging when Lennie reached for it. The next

of him, Lennie. Let go."

pretty handy. He done quite a bit in the ring. He’s a lightweight, 
and he’s handy." 
 
 "Well, let him be handy," said George, "He don’t have to take after 
Lennie. Lennie didn’t do nothing to him. What’s he got against 
Lennie?" 
 
 The swamper considered..... "Well....

closed. George slapped him in the face again and again, and still 
Lennie held on to the closed fist. Curley was white and shrunken; 
by now, and his struggling had become weak. He stood crying, his 
fist lost in Lennie's paw. 
 
 George shouted over and over, "Leggo his hand, Lennie. Leggo. 
Slim, come help me while the guy got any hand left." 
 
 Suddenly Lennie let go his hold. He crouch cowering against the 
wall. "You tol' me to, George," he said miserably.

 "Sure I will, George. I won't say a word." 
 
 "Don't let him pull you in-but-if the son-of-abitch socks you-let 'im

 "Let 'im have what, George?" 
 
 "Never mind, never mind. I'll tell you when. I hate that kind of a

=== Question 31 ===
Why has Crooks been able to accumulate more personal items than the other ranch hands?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Shoot for his guts. That'll double 'im over." 
 
 Whit said excitedly, "I ain't got a gun." 
 
 Curley said, "You go in Soledad an' get a cop. Get AI Wilts, he's 
deputy sheriff. Le's go now." He turned suspiciously on George. "You're comin' with us, fella." 
 
 "Yeah," said George. "I'll come. But listen, Curley. The poor 
bastard's nuts. Don't shoot 'im. He di'n't know what he was doin'." 
 
 "Don't shoot 'im?" Curley cried. "He got Carlson's Luger. 'Course 
we'll shoot 'im. " 
 
 George said weakly, "Maybe Carlson lost his gun.,, 
 
 "I seen it this morning," said Carlson. "No, it's been took." 
 
 Slim stood looking down at Curley's wife. He said, "Curley-maybe 
you better stay here with your wife." 
 
 Curley's face reddened. "I'm goin'," he said. "I'm gonna shoot the 
guts outa that big bastard myself, even if I only got one hand. I'm 
gonna get 'im." 
 
 Slim turned to Candy. "You stay here with her then, Candy.

--- Chunk 2 ---
"I just done it," George said tiredly. "Did he have my gun?" 
 
 "Yeah. He had your gun." 
 
 "An' you got it away from him and you took it an' you killed him?" 
 
 "Yeah. Tha's how." George's voice was almost a whisper. He 
looked steadily at his right hand that had held the gun. Slim twitched George's elbow. "Come on, George. Me an' you'll go 
in an' get a drink." 
 
 George let himself be helped to his feet. "Yeah, a drink." 
 
 Slim said, "You hadda, George. I swear you had-da. Come on with 
me." He led George into the entrance of the trail and up toward 
the highway. Curley and Carlson looked after them. And Carlson said, "Now 
what the hell ya suppose is eatin' them two guys?" 
 
 
 


--- Chunk 3 ---
  
  
answered. "Go on," said Lennie. George raised the gun and his hands shook, and he dropped his 
hand to the ground again. "Go on," said Lennie. "How's it gonna be. We gonna get a little 
place." 
 
 "We'll have a cow," said George. "An' we'll have maybe a pig an' 
chickens . .

--- Chunk 4 ---
  
  
 Carlson came running in, "The bastard's stole my Luger," he 
shouted. "It ain't in my bag." Curley followed him, and Curley 
carried a shotgun in his good hand. Curley was cold now. "All right, you guys," he said. "The nigger's got a shotgun. You 
take it, Carlson. When you see 'urn, don't give 'im no chance.

--- Chunk 5 ---
"Because-" 
 
 "Because I got you an'' 
 
 "An' I got you. We got each other, that's what, that gives a hoot in 
hell about us," Lennie cried in triumph. The little evening breeze blew over the clearing and the leaves 
rustled and the wind waves flowed up the green pool. And the 
shouts of men sounded again, this time much closer than before. George took off his hat. He said shakily, "Take off your hat, 
Lennie. The air feels fine." 
 
 Lennie removed his hat dutifully and laid it on the ground in 
front of him. The shadow in the val-ley was bluer, and the evening 
came fast. On the wind the sound of crashing in the brush came to 
them. Lennie said, "Tell how it's gonna be." 
 
 George had been listening to the distant sounds. For a moment he 
was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so 
you can almost see it." 
 
 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the 
darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," 
George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of 
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined. A man's voice called from up the river, and an-other man 


--- Chunk 6 ---
  
  
 Curley came suddenly to life. "I know who done it," he cried. "That big son-of-a-bitch done it. I know he done it. Why-ever'body 
else was out there playin' horseshoes." He worked himself into a 
fury. "I'm gonna get him. I'm going for my shotgun. I'll kill the big 
son-of-a-bitch myself. I'll shoot 'im in the guts. Come on, you 
guys." He ran furiously out of the barn. Carlson said, "I'll get my 
Luger," and he ran out too. Slim turned quietly to George. "I guess Lennie done it, all right," 
he said. "Her neck's bust. Lennie coulda did that." 
 
 George didn't answer, but he nodded slowly. His hat was so far 
down on his forehead that his eyes were covered. Slim went on, "Maybe like that time in Weed you was tellin' 
about." 
 
 Again George nodded. Slim sighed. "Well, I guess we got to get him. Where you think he 
might of went?" 
 
 It seemed to take George some time to free his words. "He-would 
of went south," he said. "We come from north so he would of went 
south." 
 
 "I guess we gotta get 'im," Slim repeated. George stepped close. "Couldn' we maybe bring him in an' they'll 
lock him up? He's nuts, Slim. He never done this to be mean." 
 
 Slim nodded. "We might," he said.

--- Chunk 7 ---
. an' me. Ever'body gonna be nice to you. Ain't gonna be 
no more trouble. Nobody gon-na hurt nobody nor steal from 'em." 
 
 Lennie said, "I thought you was mad at me, George." 
 
 "No," said George. "No, Lennie. I ain't mad. I never been mad, an' 
I ain't now. That's a thing I want ya to know." 
 
 The voices came close now. George raised the gun and listened to 
the voices. Lennie begged, "Le's do it now. Le's get that place now." 
 
 "Sure, right now. I gotta. We gotta." 
 
 And George raised the gun and steadied it, and he brought the 
muzzle of it close to the back of Lennie's head. The hand shook 
violently, but his face set and his hand steadied. He pulled the 
trigger. The crash of the shot rolled up the hills and rolled down 
again. Lennie jarred, and then settled slowly forward to the sand, 
and he lay without quivering. George shivered and looked at the gun, and then he threw it from 
him, back up on the bank, near the pile of old ashes. The brush seemed filled with cries and with the sound of running 
feet. Slim's voice shouted, "George. Where you at, George?" 
 
 But George sat stify on the bank and looked at his right hand 
that had thrown the gun away. The group burst into the clearing, 
and Curley was ahead. He saw Lennie lying on the sand. "Got 
him, by God." He went over and looked down at Lennie, and then 
he looked back at George. "Right in the back of the head," he said 
softly. 


=== Question 32 ===
What reason does Crooks first give for Lennie not being welcome in his room?

Crooks said sharply, "You got no right to come in my room. This 
here's my room. Nobody got any right in here but me." 
 
 Lennie gulped and his smile grew more fawning. "I ain't doing 
nothing," he said. "Just come to look at my puppy. And I seen your

Curley's wife moved away from him a little. "I think you're nuts,"

 She was a little bit reassured. "Well, who don't?" she said. 
"Ever'body likes that. I like to feel silk an' velvet. Do you like to

Curley's wife.

down at the hay. He knew. George said softly, "-I think I knowed from the very first I think I 
knowed we'd never do her. He usta like to hear about it so much I 
got to thinking maybe we would." 
 
 "Then-it's all off?" Candy said sulkily. George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my

 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing

 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

Where does Curley plan to aim if he shoots Lennie?

--- Chunk 1 ---
"I seen plenty of 'em. Like the 
old guy says, Curley don't take no chances. He always wins." He 
thought for a moment. "If he tangles with you, Lennie, we're 
gonna get the can. Don't make no mistake about that. He's the 
boss's son. Look, Lennie. You try to keep away from him, will you?

Curley came suddenly to life. "I know who done it," he cried. 
"That big son-of-a-bitch done it. I know he done it. Why-ever'body

fury. "I'm gonna get him. I'm going for my shotgun. I'll kill the big 
son-of-a-bitch myself. I'll shoot 'im in the guts. Come on, you

he said. "Her neck's bust. Lennie coulda did that."

 "An' I got you. We got each other, that's what, that gives a hoot in 
hell about us," Lennie cried in triumph. The little evening breeze blew over the clearing and the leaves 
rustled and the wind waves flowed up the green pool. And the 
shouts of men sounded again, this time much closer than before. George took off his hat. He said shakily, "Take off your hat, 
Lennie. The air feels fine." 
 
 Lennie removed his hat dutifully and laid it on the ground in 
front of him. The shadow in the val-ley was bluer, and the evening 
came fast. On the wind the sound of crashing in the brush came to 
them. Lennie said, "Tell how it's gonna be." 
 
 George had been listening to the distant sounds. For a moment he 
was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so 
you can almost see it." 
 
 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the 
darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," 
George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of

 THE deep green pool of the Salinas River was still in the late 
afternoon. Already the sun had left the valley to go climbing up 
the slopes of the Gabilan mountains, and the hilltops were rosy in 
the sun. But by the pool among the mottled sycamores, a pleasant 
shade had fallen. A water snake glided smoothly up the pool, twist-ing its periscope 
head from side to side; and it swam the length of the pool and 
came to the legs of a motionless heron that stood in the shallows. A silent head and beak lanced down and plucked it out by the 
head, and the beak swallowed the little snake while its tail waved 
frantically. A far rush of wind sounded and a gust drove through the tops of 
the trees like a wave. The syca-more leaves turned up their silver 
sides, the brown, dry leaves on the ground scudded a few feet. And

around the end of the last stall. "Oh, Lennie!" he called again; and 
then he stopped, and his body stiffened. He rubbed his smooth 
wrist on his white stubble whiskers. "I di'n't know you was here," 
he said to Curley's wife. When she didn't answer, he stepped nearer. "You oughten to sleep 
out here," he said disapprovingly; and then he was beside her and-
"Oh, Jesus Christ!" He looked about helplessly, and he rubbed his 
beard. And then he jumped up and went quickly out of the barn. But the barn was alive now. The horses stamped and snorted, and 
they chewed the straw of their bedding and they clashed the 
chains of their halters. In a moment Candy came back, and 
George was with him. George said, "What was it you wanted to see me about?" 
 
 Candy pointed at Curley's wife. George stared. "What's the 
matter with her?" he asked. He stepped closer, and then he echoed 
Candy's words. "Oh, Jesus Christ!" He was down on his knees 
beside her.He put his hand over her heart. And finally, when he 
stood up, slowly and stify, his face was as hard and tight as wood, 
and his eyes were hard. Candy said, "What done it?" 
 
 George looked coldly at him. "Ain't you got any idear?" he asked. And Candy was silent. "I should of knew," George said hopelessly. "I guess maybe way back in my head I did." 
 
 Candy asked, "What we gonna do now, George? What we gonna 
do now?" 
 
 George was a long time in answering. "Guess . . .

--- Chunk 4 ---
. an' me. Ever'body gonna be nice to you. Ain't gonna be 
no more trouble. Nobody gon-na hurt nobody nor steal from 'em." 
 
 Lennie said, "I thought you was mad at me, George." 
 
 "No," said George. "No, Lennie. I ain't mad. I never been mad, an' 
I ain't now. That's a thing I want ya to know." 
 
 The voices came close now. George raised the gun and listened to 
the voices. Lennie begged, "Le's do it now. Le's get that place now." 
 
 "Sure, right now. I gotta. We gotta." 
 
 And George raised the gun and steadied it, and he brought the 
muzzle of it close to the back of Lennie's head. The hand shook 
violently, but his face set and his hand steadied. He pulled the 
trigger. The crash of the shot rolled up the hills and rolled down 
again. Lennie jarred, and then settled slowly forward to the sand, 
and he lay without quivering. George shivered and looked at the gun, and then he threw it from 
him, back up on the bank, near the pile of old ashes. The brush seemed filled with cries and with the sound of running 
feet. Slim's voice shouted, "George. Where you at, George?" 
 
 But George sat stify on the bank and looked at his right hand 
that had thrown the gun away. The group burst into the clearing, 
and Curley was ahead. He saw Lennie lying on the sand. "Got 
him, by God." He went over and looked down at Lennie, and then 
he looked back at George. "Right in the back of the head," he said 
softly.

 George was tense, and motionless. "Yeah, it’s that way." 
 
 Lennie was looking helplessly to George for instruction.

 "He can talk if he wants to tell you anything." He nodded slightly

"Look, George. Look what I done." 
 
 George knelt beside the pool and drank from his hand with quick 
scoops. "Tastes all right," he admitted. "Don’t really seem to be 
running, though. You never oughta drink water when it ain’t 
running, Lennie," he said hopelessly. "You’d drink out of a gutter 
if you was thirsty." He threw a scoop of water into his face and 
rubbed it about with his hand, under his chin and around the back 
of his neck. Then he replaced his hat, pushed himself back from 
the river, drew up his knees and embraced them. Lennie, who had 
been watching, imitated George exactly. He pushed himself back, 
drew up his knees, embraced them, looked over to George to see 
whether he had it just right. He pulled his hat down a little more 
over his eyes, the way George’s hat was.

 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the

Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun
