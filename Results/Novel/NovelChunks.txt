=== Question 1 ===
When George and Lennie approach the river, why does George warn Lennie not to drink too much water?

--- Chunk 1 ---
so the water arose in little splashes; rings widened across the pool 
to the other side and came back again. Lennie watched them go. 
"Look, George. Look what I done." 
 
 George knelt beside the pool and drank from his hand with quick 
scoops. "Tastes all right," he admitted. "Don’t really seem to be 
running, though. You never oughta drink water when it ain’t 
running, Lennie," he said hopelessly. "You’d drink out of a gutter

--- Chunk 2 ---
Lennie said, "I like beans with ketchup." 
 
 "Well, we ain’t got no ketchup. You go get wood. An’ don’t you fool 
around. It’ll be dark before long." 
 
 Lennie lumbered to his feet and disappeared in the brush. George 
lay where he was and whistled softly to himself. There were 
sounds of splashings down the river in the direction Lennie had 
taken. George stopped whistling and listened, "Poor bastard," he 
said softly, and then went on whistling again.

--- Chunk 3 ---
George took off his hat. He said shakily, "Take off your hat, 
Lennie. The air feels fine." 
 
 Lennie removed his hat dutifully and laid it on the ground in 
front of him. The shadow in the val-ley was bluer, and the evening 
came fast. On the wind the sound of crashing in the brush came to 
them. 
 
 Lennie said, "Tell how it's gonna be." 
 
 George had been listening to the distant sounds. For a moment he 
was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so

--- Chunk 4 ---
"I wasn’t doin’ nothing bad with it, George. Jus’ strokin’ it." 
 
 George stood up and threw the mouse as far as he could into the 
darkening brush, and then he stepped to the pool and washed his 
hands. "You crazy fool. Don’t you think I could see your feet was 
wet where you went acrost the river to get it?" He heard Lennie’s 
whimpering cry and wheeled about. "Blubberin’ like a baby! Jesus 
Christ! A big guy like you." Lennie’s lip quivered and tears started

--- Chunk 5 ---
river, "George, you want I should go away and leave you alone?" 
 
 "Where the hell could you go?" 
 
 "Well, I could. I could go off in the hills there. Some place I’d find 
a cave." 
 
 "Yeah' How’d you eat. You ain’t got sense enough to find nothing 
to eat." 
 
 "I’d find things, George. I don’t need no nice food with ketchup. I’d 
lay out in the sun and nohody’d hurt me; An’ if I foun’ a mouse, I 
could keep it. Nobody’d take it away from me."

--- Chunk 6 ---
snorting into the water like a horse. The small man stepped 
nervously beside him. 
 
 "Lennie!" he said sharply. "Lennie, for God’ sakes don’t drink so 
much." Lennie continued to snort into the pool. The small man 
leaned over and shook him by the shoulder. "Lennie. You gonna be 
sick like you was last night." 
 
 Lennie dipped his whole head under, hat and all, and then he sat 
up on the bank and his hat dripped down on his blue coat and ran

--- Chunk 7 ---
Lennie and says, 'Jump in.' An' he jumps. Couldn't swim a stroke. 
He damn near drowned before we could get him. An' he was so 
damn nice to me for pullin' him out. Clean forgot I told him to 
jump in. Well, I ain't done nothing like that no more." 
 
 "He's a nice fella," said Slim. "Guy don't need no sense to be a nice 
fella. Seems to me sometimes it jus' works the other way around. 
Take a real smart guy and he ain't hardly ever a nice fella."

--- Chunk 8 ---
"For the rabbits," George repeated. 
 
 "And I get to tend the rabbits." 
 
 "An' you get to tend the rabbits." 
 
 Lennie giggled with happiness. "An' live on the fatta the lan'." 
 
 "Yes." 
 
 Lennie turned his head. 
 
 "No, Lennie. Look down there acrost the river, like you can 
almost see the place." 
 
 Lennie obeyed him. George looked down at the gun. 
 
 There were crashing footsteps in the brush now. George turned 
and looked toward them. 
 
 "Go on, George. When we gonna do it?"

--- Chunk 9 ---
Lennie choked with pride. "I can remember," he said. 
 
 George motioned with his spoon again. "Look, Lennie. I want you 
to look around here. You can remember this place, can’t you? The 
ranch is about a quarter mile up that way. Just follow the river?" 
 
 "Sure," said Lennie. "I can remember this. Di’n’t I remember 
about not gonna say a word?" 
 
 "’Course you did. Well, look Lennie - if you jus’ happen to get in 
trouble like you always done be fore, I want you to come right here

--- Chunk 10 ---
was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so 
you can almost see it." 
 
 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the 
darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," 
George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of 
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined.

--- Chunk 11 ---
every damn month. Get a gallon of whisky, or set in a pool room 
and play cards or shoot pool." Lennie knelt and looked over the 
fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s face was drawn with terror. 
"An’ whatta I got," George went on furiously. "I got you! You can’t 
keep a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me shovin’ all 
over the country all the time. An’ that ain’t the,' worst. You get in 
trouble. You do bad things and I got m get you out." His voice rose

--- Chunk 12 ---
"The hell you wouldn'," said the rabbit. "You ain't worth a greased 
jack-pin to ram you into hell. Christ knows George done ever'thing 
he could to jack you outa the sewer, but it don't do no good. If you 
think George gonna let you tend rabbits, you're even crazier'n 
usual. He ain't. He's gonna bear hell outa you with a stick, that's 
what he's gonna do." 
 
 Now Lennie retorted belligerently, "He ain't neither. George won't

--- Chunk 13 ---
'He better not fool with Lennie if he knows what's good for 'um.' 
That's jus' what you says to me." 
 
 George turned to Lennie. "It ain't your fault," he said. "You don't 
need to be scairt no more. You done jus' what I tol' you to. Maybe 
you better go in the ' wash room an' clean up your face. You look 
like' hell." 
 
 Lennie smiled with his bruised mouth. "I didn't want no trouble," 
he said. He walked toward the door, but just before he came to it, 
he turned back. "George?"

--- Chunk 14 ---
Maybe you wouldn’t killit. That’d be better than. mice. And you 
could pet it harder." 
 
 Lennie avoided the bait. He had sensed his advantage, "If you 
don’t want me, you only jus’ got to say so, and I’ll go off in those 
hills right there - right up in those hills and live by myself. An’ I 
won’t get no mice stole from me." 
 
 George said, "I want you to stay with me, Lennie. Jesus Christ, 
somebody’d shoot you for a coyote if you was by yourself. No, you

--- Chunk 15 ---
George was quiet for a moment. "But not us," he said. 
 
   
 
 "Because-" 
 
 "Because I got you an'' 
 
 "An' I got you. We got each other, that's what, that gives a hoot in 
hell about us," Lennie cried in triumph. 
 
 The little evening breeze blew over the clearing and the leaves 
rustled and the wind waves flowed up the green pool. And the 
shouts of men sounded again, this time much closer than before. 
 
 George took off his hat. He said shakily, "Take off your hat,


=== Question 2 ===
What has George told Lennie about that he always remembers even when he forgets everything else?

--- Chunk 1 ---
did, George." 
 
 "O.K.- O.K. I’ll tell ya again. I ain’t got nothing to do. Might jus’ 
as well spen’ all my time tellin’ you things and then you forget 
’em, and I tell you again." 
 
 "Tried and tried," said Lennie, "but it didn’t do no good. I 
remember about the rabbits, George." 
 
 "The hell with the rabbits. That’s all you ever can remember is 
them rabbits. O.K.! Now you listen and this time you got to 
remember so we don’t get in no trouble. You remember settin’ in

--- Chunk 2 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 3 ---
into Lennie's brain. 
 
 George said quietly, "What the hell you yellin' about?" 
 
 Lennie got up on his knees. "You ain't gonna leave me, are ya, 
George? I know you ain't." 
 
 George came stiffly near and sat down beside him. 
 
 "No." 
 
 "I knowed it," Lennie cried. "You ain't that kind." 
 
 George was silent. 
 
 Lennie said, "George." 
 
 "Yeah ?" 
 
 "I done another bad thing." 
 
 "It don't make no difference," George said, and he fell silent 
again.

--- Chunk 4 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

--- Chunk 5 ---
dollars." His tone grew decisive. "You keep away from Curley, 
Lennie." 
 
 "Sure I will, George. I won't say a word." 
 
 "Don't let him pull you in-but-if the son-of-abitch socks you-let 'im 
have it." 
 
 "Let 'im have what, George?" 
 
 "Never mind, never mind. I'll tell you when. I hate that kind of a 
guy. Look, Lennie, if you get in any kind of trouble, you remember 
what I told you to do?" 
 
 Lennie raised up on his elbow. His face contorted with thought.

--- Chunk 6 ---
"Tell you what?" 
 
 "About the rabbits." 
 
 George snapped, "You ain’t gonna put nothing over on me." 
 
 Lennie pleads "Come on, George. Tell me. Please, George. Like 
you done before." 
 
 "You get a kick outta that, don’t you? Awright, I’ll tell you, and 
then we’ll eat our supper...." 
 
 George’s voice became deeper. He repeated his words 
rhythmically as though he had said them many times before. 
"Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the

--- Chunk 7 ---
the mountains seemed to blaze with increasing brightness. 
 
 Lennie said softly, "I di'n't forget, you bet, God damn. Hide in the 
brush an' wait for George." He pulled his hat down low over his 
eyes. "George gonna give me hell," he said. "George gonna wish he 
was alone an' not have me botherin' him." He turned his head and 
looked at the bright mountain tops. "I can go right off there an' 
find a cave," he said. And he continued sadly, "-an' never have no

--- Chunk 8 ---
ya talk, we’re set. Ya got that?" 
 
 "Sure, George. Sure I got it." 
 
 "O.K. Now when we go in to see the boss, what you gonna do?" 
 
 "I.... I," Lennie thought. His face grew tight with thought. "I.... 
ain’t gonna say nothin’. Jus’ gonna stan’ there." 
 
 "Good boy. That’s swell. You say that over two, three times so you 
sure won’t forget it." 
 
 Lennie droned to himself softly, "I ain’t gonna say nothin’.... I 
ain’t gonna say nothin’.... I ain’t gonna say nothin’."

--- Chunk 9 ---
he can't come back." 
 
 Lennie struggled to understand. "George won't do nothing like 
that," he repeated.."George is careful. He won't get hurt. He ain't 
never been hurt, 'cause he's careful." 
 
 "Well, s'pose, jus' s'pose he don't come back. What'll you do then?" 
 
 Lennie's face wrinkled with apprehension. "I don' know. Say, 
what you doin' anyways?" he cried. "This ain't true. George ain't 
got hurt."

--- Chunk 10 ---
take my fifty bucks' " 
 
 "Jesus Christ, Lennie! You can't remember nothing that happens, 
but you remember ever' word I say.„ 
 
 "Well, ain't you gonna say it?" 
 
 George shook himself. He said woodenly, "If I was alone I could 
live so easy." His voice was mo-notonous, had no emphasis. "I 
could get a job an' not have no mess." He stopped 
 
 "Go on," said Lennie. "An' when the enda the month come-" 
 
 "An' when the end of the month come I could take my fifty bucks

--- Chunk 11 ---
could keep it. Nobody’d take it away from me." 
 
 George looked quickly and searchingly at him. "I been mean, ain’t 
I?" 
 
 "If you don’ want me I can go off in the hills an’ find a cave. I can 
go away any time." 
 
 "No - look! I was jus’ foolin’, Lennie. ’Cause'. I want you to stay 
with me. Trouble with mice is you always kill ’em." He paused. 
"Tell you what I’ll do, Lennie. First chance I get I'll give you a pup. 
Maybe you wouldn’t killit. That’d be better than. mice. And you

--- Chunk 12 ---
"It ain't so funny, him an' me goin' aroun' together," George said 
at last. "Him and me was both born in Auburn. I knowed his Aunt 
Clara. She took him when he was a baby and raised him up. When 
his Aunt Clara died, Lennie just come along with me out workin'. 
Got kinda used to each other after a little while." 
 
 "Umm," said Slim. 
 
 George looked over at Slim and saw the calm, Godlike eyes 
fastened on him. "Funny," said George. "I used to have a hell of a

--- Chunk 13 ---
chewed mightily. A few beans slipped out of the side of Lennie’s 
mouth. George gestured with his spoon. "What you gonna say 
tomorrow when the boss asks you questions?" 
 
 Lennie stopped chewing and swallowed. His face was 
concentrated. "I.... I ain’t gonna.... say a word." 
 
 "Good boy! That’s fine, Lennie! Maybe you’re gettin’ better. When 
we get the coupla acres I can let you tend the rabbits all right. 
’Specially if you remember as good as that."

--- Chunk 14 ---
And Lennie answered her, "I tried, Aunt Clara, ma'am. I tried 
and tried. I couldn' help it." 
 
 "You never give a thought to George," she went on in Lennie's 
voice. "He been doin' nice things for you alla time. When he got a 
piece of pie you always got half or more'n half. An' if they was any 
ketchup, why he'd give it all to you." 
 
 "I know," said Lennie miserably. "I tried, Aunt Clara, ma'am. I 
tried and tried." 
 
 She interrupted him. "All the time he coulda had such a good

--- Chunk 15 ---
paused. 
 
 His voice grew soft and persuasive. "S'pose George don't come 
back no more. S'pose he took a powder and just ain't coming back. 
What'll you do then?" 
 
 Lennie's attention came gradually to what had been said. "What?" 
he demanded. 
 
 "I said s'pose George went into town tonight and you never heard 
of him no more." Crooks pressed forward some kind of private 
victory. "Just s'pose that," he repeated. 
 
 "He won't do it," Lennie cried. "George wouldn't do nothing like


=== Question 3 ===
Why does Lennie have a dead mouse in his pocket?

--- Chunk 1 ---
"Give ithere!" 
 
 Lennie’s closed hand slowly obeyed. George took the mouse and 
threw it across the pool to the other side, among the brush. "What 
you want of a dead mouse, anyways?" 
 
 "I could pet it with my thumb while we walked along," said 
Lennie. 
 
 "Well, you ain’t petting no mice while you walk with me. You 
remember where we’re goin’ now?" 
 
 Lennie looked startled and then in embarrassment hid his face 
against his knees. "I forgot again."

--- Chunk 2 ---
Christ! A big guy like you." Lennie’s lip quivered and tears started 
in his eyes. "Aw, Lennie!" George put his hand on Lennie’s 
shoulder. "I ain’t takin’ it away jus’ for ' meanness. That mouse 
ain’t fresh, Lennie; and besides, you’ve broke it pettin’ it. You get 
another mouse that’s fresh and I’ll let you keep it a little while." 
 
 Lennie sat down on the ground and hung his head dejectedly, "I 
don’t know where there is no other mouse. I remember a lady used

--- Chunk 3 ---
hand - hidin’ it?" 
 
 "I ain’t got nothin’, George, Honest." 
 
 "Come on, give it here." 
 
 Lennie held his closed hand away from George's direction. "It’s 
only a mouse, George." 
 
 "A mouse? A live mouse?" 
 
 "Uh-uh. Jus’ a dead mouse, George. I didn’ kill it. ’ Honest! I 
found it. I found it dead." 
 
 "Give it here!" said George. 
 
 "Aw, leave me have it, George." 
 
 "Give ithere!" 
 
 Lennie’s closed hand slowly obeyed. George took the mouse and

--- Chunk 4 ---
could keep it. Nobody’d take it away from me." 
 
 George looked quickly and searchingly at him. "I been mean, ain’t 
I?" 
 
 "If you don’ want me I can go off in the hills an’ find a cave. I can 
go away any time." 
 
 "No - look! I was jus’ foolin’, Lennie. ’Cause'. I want you to stay 
with me. Trouble with mice is you always kill ’em." He paused. 
"Tell you what I’ll do, Lennie. First chance I get I'll give you a pup. 
Maybe you wouldn’t killit. That’d be better than. mice. And you

pocket." His hand went into the pocket again. 
 
 George looked sharply at him. "What’d you take outa that 
pocket?" 
 
 "Ain’t a thing in my pocket," Lennie said cleverly. 
 
 "I know there ain’t. You got it in your hand. What you got in your

--- Chunk 6 ---
Only Lennie was in the barn, and Lennie sat in the hay beside a 
packing case under a manger in the end of the barn that had not 
been filled with hay. Lennie sat in the hay and looked at a little 
dead puppy that lay in front of him. Lennie looked at it for a long 
time, and then he put out his huge hand and stroked it, stroked it 
clear from one end to the other. 
 
 And Lennie said softly to the puppy, "Why do you got to get

--- Chunk 7 ---
an' he made like he's gonna bite me . . . . an' I made like I was 
gonna smack him . . . . an' . . . . an' I done it. An' then he was 
dead." 
 
 She consoled him. "Don't you worry none. He was jus' a mutt. You 
can get another one easy. The whole country is fulla mutts." 
 
 "It ain't that so much," Lennie explained miserably. "George ain't 
gonna let me tend no rabbits now." 
 
 "Why don't he?" 
 
 "Well, he said if I done any more bad things he ain't gonna let me 
tend the rabbits."

--- Chunk 8 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 9 ---
Lennie stuck out his hands. 
 
 "Christ awmighty, I hate to have you mad at me," Slim said. 
 
 George broke in, "Lennie was jus' scairt," he explained. "He didn't 
know what to do. I told you nobody ought never to fight him. No, I 
guess it was Candy I told." 
 
 Candy nodded solemnly. "That's jus' what you done," he said. 
"Right this morning when Curley first lit into your fren', you says, 
'He better not fool with Lennie if he knows what's good for 'um.'

--- Chunk 10 ---
clear from one end to the other. 
 
 And Lennie said softly to the puppy, "Why do you got to get 
killed? You ain't so little as mice. I didn't bounce you hard." He 
bent the pup's head up and looked in its face, and he said to it, 
"Now maybe George ain't gonna let me tend no rabbits, if he fin's 
out you got killed." 
 
 He scooped a little hollow and laid the puppy in it and covered it 
over with hay, out of sight; but he continued to stare at the mound

dollars." His tone grew decisive. "You keep away from Curley, 
Lennie." 
 
 "Sure I will, George. I won't say a word." 
 
 "Don't let him pull you in-but-if the son-of-abitch socks you-let 'im 
have it." 
 
 "Let 'im have what, George?" 
 
 "Never mind, never mind. I'll tell you when. I hate that kind of a 
guy. Look, Lennie, if you get in any kind of trouble, you remember 
what I told you to do?" 
 
 Lennie raised up on his elbow. His face contorted with thought.

--- Chunk 12 ---
machines." 
 
 Candy broke in. "You let this guy alone. Don't you do no messing 
aroun' with him. I'm gonna tell George what you says. George 
won't have you messin' with Lennie." 
 
 "Who's George?" she asked. "The little guy you come with?" 
 
 Lennie smiled happily. "That's him," he said. "That's the guy, an' 
he's gonna let me tend the rabbits." 
 
 "Well, if that's all you want, I might get a couple rabbits myself." 
 
 Crooks stood up from his bunk and faced her. "I had enough," he

--- Chunk 13 ---
and I pinched their heads a little and then they was dead - 
because they was so little. 
 
 "I wish’t we’d get the rabbits pretty soon, George. They ain’t so 
little." 
 
 "The hell with the rabbits. An’ you ain’t to be trusted with no live 
mice; Your Aunt Clara give you a rubber mouse and you wouldn’t 
have nothing to do with it." 
 
 "It wasn’t no good to pet," said Lennie. 
 
 The flame of the sunset lifted from the mountain-tops and dusk

--- Chunk 14 ---
Lennie's eyes moved down over her body, and though she did not 
seem to be looking at Lennie she bridled a little. She looked at her 
fingernails. "Sometimes Curley's in here," she explained. 
 
 George said brusquely, "Well he ain't now." 
 
 "If he ain't, I guess I better look some place else," she said 
playfully. 
 
 Lennie watched her, fascinated. George said, "If I see him, I'll 
pass the word you was looking for him.

--- Chunk 15 ---
"It's George," Lennie cried. And he answered, "Here, George. I'm 
right in here." 
 
 In a second George stood framed in the door, and he looked 
disapprovingly about. "What you doin' in Crooks' room? You 
hadn't ought to lie here." 
 
 Crooks nodded "I tol' 'em, but they come in anyways." 
 
 "Well, why'n't you kick'em out?" 
 
 "I di'n't care much," said Crooks. "Lennie's a nice fella." 
 
 Now Candy aroused himself. "Oh, George! I been figurin' and


=== Question 4 ===
Why does George order Lennie not to talk when they get to the ranch?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Lennie choked with pride. "I can remember," he said. 
 
 George motioned with his spoon again. "Look, Lennie. I want you 
to look around here. You can remember this place, can’t you? The 
ranch is about a quarter mile up that way. Just follow the river?" 
 
 "Sure," said Lennie. "I can remember this. Di’n’t I remember 
about not gonna say a word?" 
 
 "’Course you did. Well, look Lennie - if you jus’ happen to get in 
trouble like you always done be fore, I want you to come right here

--- Chunk 2 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

--- Chunk 3 ---
Lennie giggled happily. "I didn’t forget that, you bet." 
 
 George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his 
head, and Lennie imitated him, raising his head to see whether he 
were doing it right. "God, you’re a lot of trouble," said George. "I 
could get along so easy and so nice if I didn’t have you on my tail. I 
could live so easy and maybe have a girl." 
 
 For a moment Lennie lay quiet, and then he said hopefully, "We 
gonna work on a ranch, George."

--- Chunk 4 ---
no fun. After a long time they get mean. They get wantin' to fight 
all the time. 
 
 "Yeah, they get mean," Slim agreed. "They get so they don't want 
to talk to nobody." 
 
 "'Course Lennie's a God damn nuisance most of the time," said 
George. "But you get used to goin' around with a guy an' you can't 
get rid of him." 
 
 "He ain't mean," said Slim. "I can see Lennie ain't a bit mean." 
 
 "'Course he ain't mean. But he gets in trouble alla time because

looked sullenly up at her.She said, "What you got there, sonny 
boy?" 
 
 Lennie glared at her. "George says I ain't to have nothing to do 
with you-talk to you or nothing." 
 
 She laughed "George giving you orders about everything?" 
 
 Lennie looked down at the hay. "Says I can't tend no rabbits if I 
talk to you or anything." 
 
 She said quietly, "He's scared Curley'll get mad. Well, Curley got 
his arm in a sling-an' if Curley gets tough, you can break his other

--- Chunk 6 ---
"I never meant no harm, George. Honest I never." 
 
 "Well, you keep away from her, 'cause she's a rattrap if I ever 
seen one. You let Curley take the rap. He let himself in for it. 
Glove fulla vaseline," George said disgustedly. "An' I bet he's eatin' 
raw eggs and writin' to the patent medicine houses." 
 
 Lennie cried out suddenly-"I don' like this place, George. This 
ain't no good place. I wanna get outa here." 
 
 "We gotta keep it till we get a stake. We can't help it, Lennie.

"Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the 
world. They got no family. They don’t belong no place. They come 
to a ranch an’ work up a stake and then they go inta town and 
blow their stake, and the first thing you know they’re poundin’ 
their tail on some other ranch. They ain’t got nothing to look 
ahead to." 
 
 Lennie was delighted. "That’s it - that’s it. Now tell how it is with 
us." 
 
 George went on. "With us it ain’t like that. We got a future. We

George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

into Lennie's brain. 
 
 George said quietly, "What the hell you yellin' about?" 
 
 Lennie got up on his knees. "You ain't gonna leave me, are ya, 
George? I know you ain't." 
 
 George came stiffly near and sat down beside him. 
 
 "No." 
 
 "I knowed it," Lennie cried. "You ain't that kind." 
 
 George was silent. 
 
 Lennie said, "George." 
 
 "Yeah ?" 
 
 "I done another bad thing." 
 
 "It don't make no difference," George said, and he fell silent 
again.

--- Chunk 10 ---
Maybe you wouldn’t killit. That’d be better than. mice. And you 
could pet it harder." 
 
 Lennie avoided the bait. He had sensed his advantage, "If you 
don’t want me, you only jus’ got to say so, and I’ll go off in those 
hills right there - right up in those hills and live by myself. An’ I 
won’t get no mice stole from me." 
 
 George said, "I want you to stay with me, Lennie. Jesus Christ, 
somebody’d shoot you for a coyote if you was by yourself. No, you

under the look and shifted his feet nervously. Curley stepped 
gingerly close to him. "You the new guys the old man was waitin' 
for?" 
 
 "We just come in," said George. 
 
 "Let the big gay talk." 
 
 Lennie twisted with embarrassment. 
 
 George said, "S’pose he don't want to talk?" 
 
 Curley lashed his body around. "By Christ,' he's gotta talk when 
he’s spoke to. What the hell are you gettin’ into it for?" 
 
 "We travel together," said George coldly.

--- Chunk 12 ---
For a moment Lennie lay quiet, and then he said hopefully, "We 
gonna work on a ranch, George." 
 
 "Awright. You got that. But we’re gonna sleep here because I got 
a reason." 
 
 The day was going fast now. Only the tops of the Gabilan 
mountains flamed with the light of the sun that hid gone from the 
valley. A water snake slipped along on the pool, its head held up 
like a little periscope. The reeds jerked slightly in the current. Far

Didn’t wanta stop at the ranch gate, that’s what. Too God damn 
lazy to pull up. Wonder he isn’t too damn good to stop in Soledad 
at all. Kicks us out and says, ‘Jes’ a little stretch down the road.’ I 
bet it wasmore than four miles. Damn hot day." 
 
 Lennie looked timidly over to him. "George?" 
 
 "Yeah, what ya want?" 
 
 "Where we goin’, George?"

together and turned around to Lennie. Lennie was lying down on 
the bunk watching him. 
 
 "Look, Lennie! This here ain't no set up. I'm scared. You gonna 
have trouble with that Curley guy. I seen that kind before. He was 
kinda feelin' you out. He figures he's got you scared and he's 
gonna take a sock at you the first chance he gets." 
 
 Lennie's eyes were frightened. "I don't want no trouble," he said 
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George."

--- Chunk 15 ---
I wasn't drunk. I don't know if I was asleep. If some guy was with 
me, he could tell me I was asleep, an' then it would be all right. 
But I jus' don't know." Crooks was looking across the room now, 
looking toward the window. 
 
 Lennie said miserably, "George won't go away and leave me. I 
know George wun't do that." 
 
 The stable buck went on dreamily, "I remember when I was a 
little kid on my old man's chicken ranch. Had two brothers. They

 George looked quickly and searchingly at him. "I been mean, ain’t 
I?" 
 
 "If you don’ want me I can go off in the hills an’ find a cave. I can 
go away any time." 
 
 "No - look! I was jus’ foolin’, Lennie. ’Cause'. I want you to stay 
with me. Trouble with mice is you always kill ’em." He paused. 
"Tell you what I’ll do, Lennie. First chance I get I'll give you a pup. 
Maybe you wouldn’t killit. That’d be better than. mice. And you

Christ! A big guy like you." Lennie’s lip quivered and tears started 
in his eyes. "Aw, Lennie!" George put his hand on Lennie’s 
shoulder. "I ain’t takin’ it away jus’ for ' meanness. That mouse 
ain’t fresh, Lennie; and besides, you’ve broke it pettin’ it. You get 
another mouse that’s fresh and I’ll let you keep it a little while." 
 
 Lennie sat down on the ground and hung his head dejectedly, "I 
don’t know where there is no other mouse. I remember a lady used

--- Chunk 3 ---
"Give ithere!" 
 
 Lennie’s closed hand slowly obeyed. George took the mouse and 
threw it across the pool to the other side, among the brush. "What 
you want of a dead mouse, anyways?" 
 
 "I could pet it with my thumb while we walked along," said 
Lennie. 
 
 "Well, you ain’t petting no mice while you walk with me. You 
remember where we’re goin’ now?" 
 
 Lennie looked startled and then in embarrassment hid his face 
against his knees. "I forgot again."

--- Chunk 4 ---
and I pinched their heads a little and then they was dead - 
because they was so little. 
 
 "I wish’t we’d get the rabbits pretty soon, George. They ain’t so 
little." 
 
 "The hell with the rabbits. An’ you ain’t to be trusted with no live 
mice; Your Aunt Clara give you a rubber mouse and you wouldn’t 
have nothing to do with it." 
 
 "It wasn’t no good to pet," said Lennie. 
 
 The flame of the sunset lifted from the mountain-tops and dusk

 She interrupted him. "All the time he coulda had such a good 
time if it wasn't for you. He woulda took his pay an' raised hell in 
a whore house, and he coulda set in a poolroom an' played 
snooker. But he got to take care of you." 
 
 Lennie moaned with grief. "I know, Aunt Clara, ma'am. I'll go 
right off in the hills an' I'll fin' a cave an' I'll live there so I won't 
be no more trouble to George."

--- Chunk 6 ---
hand - hidin’ it?" 
 
 "I ain’t got nothin’, George, Honest." 
 
 "Come on, give it here." 
 
 Lennie held his closed hand away from George's direction. "It’s 
only a mouse, George." 
 
 "A mouse? A live mouse?" 
 
 "Uh-uh. Jus’ a dead mouse, George. I didn’ kill it. ’ Honest! I 
found it. I found it dead." 
 
 "Give it here!" said George. 
 
 "Aw, leave me have it, George." 
 
 "Give ithere!" 
 
 Lennie’s closed hand slowly obeyed. George took the mouse and

--- Chunk 7 ---
And Lennie answered her, "I tried, Aunt Clara, ma'am. I tried 
and tried. I couldn' help it." 
 
 "You never give a thought to George," she went on in Lennie's 
voice. "He been doin' nice things for you alla time. When he got a 
piece of pie you always got half or more'n half. An' if they was any 
ketchup, why he'd give it all to you." 
 
 "I know," said Lennie miserably. "I tried, Aunt Clara, ma'am. I 
tried and tried." 
 
 She interrupted him. "All the time he coulda had such a good

--- Chunk 8 ---
an' he made like he's gonna bite me . . . . an' I made like I was 
gonna smack him . . . . an' . . . . an' I done it. An' then he was 
dead." 
 
 She consoled him. "Don't you worry none. He was jus' a mutt. You 
can get another one easy. The whole country is fulla mutts." 
 
 "It ain't that so much," Lennie explained miserably. "George ain't 
gonna let me tend no rabbits now." 
 
 "Why don't he?" 
 
 "Well, he said if I done any more bad things he ain't gonna let me 
tend the rabbits."

--- Chunk 9 ---
Only Lennie was in the barn, and Lennie sat in the hay beside a 
packing case under a manger in the end of the barn that had not 
been filled with hay. Lennie sat in the hay and looked at a little 
dead puppy that lay in front of him. Lennie looked at it for a long 
time, and then he put out his huge hand and stroked it, stroked it 
clear from one end to the other. 
 
 And Lennie said softly to the puppy, "Why do you got to get

--- Chunk 10 ---
be no more trouble to George." 
 
 "You jus' say that," she said sharply. "You're al-ways sayin' that, 
an' you know sonofabitching well you ain't never gonna do it. 
You'll jus' stick around an' stew the b'Jesus outa George all the 
time." 
 
 Lennie said, "I might jus' as well go away. George ain't gonna let 
me tend no rabbits now." 
 
 Aunt Clara was gone, and from out of Lennie's head there came a

George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 12 ---
Lennie's eyes moved down over her body, and though she did not 
seem to be looking at Lennie she bridled a little. She looked at her 
fingernails. "Sometimes Curley's in here," she explained. 
 
 George said brusquely, "Well he ain't now." 
 
 "If he ain't, I guess I better look some place else," she said 
playfully. 
 
 Lennie watched her, fascinated. George said, "If I see him, I'll 
pass the word you was looking for him.

machines." 
 
 Candy broke in. "You let this guy alone. Don't you do no messing 
aroun' with him. I'm gonna tell George what you says. George 
won't have you messin' with Lennie." 
 
 "Who's George?" she asked. "The little guy you come with?" 
 
 Lennie smiled happily. "That's him," he said. "That's the guy, an' 
he's gonna let me tend the rabbits." 
 
 "Well, if that's all you want, I might get a couple rabbits myself." 
 
 Crooks stood up from his bunk and faced her. "I had enough," he

--- Chunk 14 ---
"Well, he said if I done any more bad things he ain't gonna let me 
tend the rabbits." 
 
 She moved closer to him and she spoke soothingly. "Don't you 
worry about talkie' to me. Listen to the guys yell out there. They 
got four dollars bet in that tenement. None of them ain't gonna 
leave till it's over." 
 
 "If George sees me talkin' to you he'll give me hell," Lennie said 
cautiously. "He tol' me so." 
 
 Her face grew angry. "Wha's the matter with me?" she cried.

--- Chunk 15 ---
clear from one end to the other. 
 
 And Lennie said softly to the puppy, "Why do you got to get 
killed? You ain't so little as mice. I didn't bounce you hard." He 
bent the pup's head up and looked in its face, and he said to it, 
"Now maybe George ain't gonna let me tend no rabbits, if he fin's 
out you got killed." 
 
 He scooped a little hollow and laid the puppy in it and covered it 
over with hay, out of sight; but he continued to stare at the mound


=== Question 6 ===
Why have George and Lennie run away from Weed?

Luger," and he ran out too. 
 
 Slim turned quietly to George. "I guess Lennie done it, all right," 
he said. "Her neck's bust. Lennie coulda did that." 
 
 George didn't answer, but he nodded slowly. His hat was so far 
down on his forehead that his eyes were covered. 
 
 Slim went on, "Maybe like that time in Weed you was tellin' 
about." 
 
 Again George nodded.

--- Chunk 2 ---
ain’t gonna say nothin’.... I ain’t gonna say nothin’." 
 
 "O.K.," said George. "An’ you ain’t gonna do no bad things like you 
done in Weed, neither." 
 
 Lennie looked puzzled. "Like I done in Weed?" 
 
 "Oh, so ya forgot that too, did ya. Well, I ain’t gonna remind ya, 
fear ya do it again." 
 
 A light of understanding broke on Lennie’s face. "They run us 
outa Weed," he exploded triumphantly. 
 
 "Run us out, hell," said George disgustedly. "We run. They was

--- Chunk 3 ---
every damn month. Get a gallon of whisky, or set in a pool room 
and play cards or shoot pool." Lennie knelt and looked over the 
fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s face was drawn with terror. 
"An’ whatta I got," George went on furiously. "I got you! You can’t 
keep a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me shovin’ all 
over the country all the time. An’ that ain’t the,' worst. You get in 
trouble. You do bad things and I got m get you out." His voice rose

said. "A guy can go in an' get drunk and get ever'thing outa his 
system all at once, an' no messes. And he knows how much it's 
gonna set him back. These here jail baits is just set on the trigger 
of the hoosegow." 
 
 Lennie followed his words admiringly, and moved his lips a little 
to keep up. George continued, "You remember Andy Cushman, 
Lennie? Went to grammar school?" 
 
 "The one that his old lady used to make hot cakes for the kids?" 
Lennie asked.

--- Chunk 5 ---
"Run us out, hell," said George disgustedly. "We run. They was 
lookin’ for us, but they didn’t catch us.

--- Chunk 6 ---
"I never meant no harm, George. Honest I never." 
 
 "Well, you keep away from her, 'cause she's a rattrap if I ever 
seen one. You let Curley take the rap. He let himself in for it. 
Glove fulla vaseline," George said disgustedly. "An' I bet he's eatin'

 "Up around Weed," said George. 
 
 "You, too?" to Lennie. 
 
 "Yeah, him too," said George.

 "No, he ain’t, but he’s sure a hell of a good worker. Strong as a

Slim went on, "Maybe like that time in Weed you was tellin'

 Again George nodded. 
 
 Slim sighed. "Well, I guess we got to get him. Where you think he 
might of went?" 
 
 It seemed to take George some time to free his words. "He-would 
of went south," he said. "We come from north so he would of went 
south." 
 
 "I guess we gotta get 'im," Slim repeated. 
 
 George stepped close. "Couldn' we maybe bring him in an' they'll

 "Yeah, they get mean," Slim agreed. "They get so they don't want

 "'Course Lennie's a God damn nuisance most of the time," said 
George. "But you get used to goin' around with a guy an' you can't

 "He ain't mean," said Slim. "I can see Lennie ain't a bit mean." 
 
 "'Course he ain't mean. But he gets in trouble alla time because

"He won't do it," Lennie cried. "George wouldn't do nothing like 
that. I been with George a long time. He'll come back tonight-" But 
the doubt was too much for him. "Don't you think he will?" 
 
 Crooks' face lighted with pleasure in his torture. 
 
 "Nobody can't tell what a guy'll do," he observed calmly. "Le's say 
he wants to come back and can't. S'pose he gets killed or hurt so 
he can't come back." 
 
 Lennie struggled to understand. "George won't do nothing like

--- Chunk 13 ---
with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at ’em because he ain’t a big 
guy. You seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?"

cow or a goat, and the cream is so God damn thick you got to cut it 
with a knife and take it out with a spoon." 
 
 Lennie watched him with wide eyes, and old Candy watched him 
too. Lennie said softly, "We could live offa the fatta the lan'." 
 
 "Sure," said George. "All kin's a vegetables in the garden, and if 
we want a little whisky we can sell a few eggs or something, or 
some milk. We'd jus' live there. We'd belong there. There wouldn't

Tomorra we’re gonna go to work I seen thrashin’ machines on the 
way down. That means we’ll be bucking grain bags, bustin’ a gut. 
Tonight I’m gonna lay right here and look up. I like it." 
 
 Lennie got up on his knees and looked down at George. "Ain’t we 
gonna have no supper?" 
 
 "Sure we are, if you gather up some dead willow sticks, I got three 
cans of beans in my bindle. You get a fire ready. I’ll give you a 
match when you get the sticks together. Then we’ll heat the beans

--- Chunk 4 ---
Lennie said, "I like beans with ketchup." 
 
 "Well, we ain’t got no ketchup. You go get wood. An’ don’t you fool 
around. It’ll be dark before long." 
 
 Lennie lumbered to his feet and disappeared in the brush. George 
lay where he was and whistled softly to himself. There were 
sounds of splashings down the river in the direction Lennie had 
taken. George stopped whistling and listened, "Poor bastard," he 
said softly, and then went on whistling again.

--- Chunk 5 ---
"O.K. Someday - we’re gonna get the jack together and we’re 
gonna have a little house and a couple of acres an’ a cow and some 
pigs and -" 
 
 "An’ live off the fatta the lan’,"Lennie shouted. "An’ haverabbits. 
Go on, George! Tell about what we’re gonna have in the garden

 Lennie smiled to himself. "Strong as a bull," he repeated. George 
scowled at him, and Lennie dropped his head in shame at having 
forgotten. 
 
 The boss said suddenly, "Listen, Small!" Lennie raised his head. 
What can you do?" 
 
 In a panic, Lennie looked at George for help. "He can do anything 
you.tell him," said George. "He’ a good skinner. He can rassel 
grain bags, drive cultivator. He can do anything. Just give him a 
try."

be no more runnin' round the country and gettin' fed by a Jap 
cook. No, sir, we'd have our own place where we belonged and not 
sleep in no bunt house." 
 
 "Tell about the house, George," Lennie begged. 
 
 "Sure, we'd have a little house an' a room to ourself. Little fat iron 
stove, an' in the winter we'd keep a fire goin' in it. It ain't enough 
land so we'd have to work too hard. Maybe six, seven hours a day.

alfalfa is for the rabbits, an' I take a sack and get it all fulla alfalfa 
and then I take it to the rabbits." 
 
 She asked, "What makes you so nuts about rabbits?" 
 
 Lennie had to think carefully before he could come to a 
conclusion. He moved cautiously close to her, until he was right 
against her. "I like to pet nice things. Once at a fair I seen some of

  "Go on," said Lennie. 
 
 George raised the gun and his hands shook, and he dropped his

waggled its ears and crinkled its nose at him. And it spoke in 
Lennie's voice too. 
 
 "Tend rabbits," it said scornfully. "You crazy bastard. You ain't fit 
to lick the boots of no rabbit. You'd forget 'em and let 'em go 
hungry. That's what you'd do. An' then what would George think?" 
 
 "I would not forget," Lennie said loudly. 
 
 "The hell you wouldn'," said the rabbit. "You ain't worth a greased

ain't never raised his ban' to me with a stick. He's nice to me. He 
ain't gonna be mean." 
 
 "Well, he's sick of you," said the rabbit. "He's gonna beat hell outa 
you an' then go away an' leave you." 
 
 "He won't," Lennie cried frantically. "He won't do nothing like 
that. I know George. Me an' him travels together."

find a cave," he said. And he continued sadly, "-an' never have no 
ketchup-but I won't care. If George don't want me . . . . I'll go 
away. I'll go away." 
 
 And then from out of Lennie's head there came a little fat old 
woman. She wore thick bull's-eye glasses and she wore a huge


=== Question 8 ===
Why does George say that migrant workers who travel from farm to farm are the loneliest people in the world?

--- Chunk 1 ---
"Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the 
world. They got no family. They don’t belong no place. They come 
to a ranch an’ work up a stake and then they go inta town and 
blow their stake, and the first thing you know they’re poundin’ 
their tail on some other ranch. They ain’t got nothing to look 
ahead to." 
 
 Lennie was delighted. "That’s it - that’s it. Now tell how it is with 
us." 
 
 George went on. "With us it ain’t like that. We got a future. We

river, "George, you want I should go away and leave you alone?" 
 
 "Where the hell could you go?" 
 
 "Well, I could. I could go off in the hills there. Some place I’d find 
a cave." 
 
 "Yeah' How’d you eat. You ain’t got sense enough to find nothing 
to eat." 
 
 "I’d find things, George. I don’t need no nice food with ketchup. I’d 
lay out in the sun and nohody’d hurt me; An’ if I foun’ a mouse, I 
could keep it. Nobody’d take it away from me."

--- Chunk 3 ---
"Hell, yes," said George. "I ain't nothing to scream about, but that 
big bastard there can put up more grain alone than most pairs 
can."

--- Chunk 4 ---
it all in one month. George got the land all picked out, too." 
 
 Crooks reached around and explored his spine with his hand. "I 
never seen a guy really do it," he said. "I seen guys nearly crazy 
with loneliness for land, but ever' time a whore house or a 
blackjack game took what it takes." He hesitated. If you . . . . guys 
would want a hand to work for nothing-just his keep, why I'd come 
an' lend a hand. I ain't so crippled I can't work like a son-of-a-bitch 
if I want to."

--- Chunk 5 ---
"O.K. Someday - we’re gonna get the jack together and we’re 
gonna have a little house and a couple of acres an’ a cow and some 
pigs and -" 
 
 "An’ live off the fatta the lan’,"Lennie shouted. "An’ haverabbits. 
Go on, George! Tell about what we’re gonna have in the garden 
and about the rabbits in the cages and about the rain in the 
winter and the stove, and how thick the cream is an the milk like 
you can hardly cut it. Tell about that, George."

--- Chunk 6 ---
Maybe you wouldn’t killit. That’d be better than. mice. And you 
could pet it harder." 
 
 Lennie avoided the bait. He had sensed his advantage, "If you 
don’t want me, you only jus’ got to say so, and I’ll go off in those 
hills right there - right up in those hills and live by myself. An’ I 
won’t get no mice stole from me." 
 
 George said, "I want you to stay with me, Lennie. Jesus Christ, 
somebody’d shoot you for a coyote if you was by yourself. No, you

--- Chunk 7 ---
"It don't make no difference," George said, and he fell silent 
again. 
 
 Only the topmost ridges were in the sun now. The shadow in the 
valley was blue and soft. From the distance came the sound of 
men shouting to one another. George turned his head and listened 
to the shouts. 
 
 Lennie said, "George." 
 
 "Yeah ?" 
 
 "Ain't you gonna give me hell?" 
 
 "Give ya hell?" 
 
 "Sure, like you always done before. Like, `If I di'n't have you I'd

against his knees. "I forgot again." 
 
 "Jesus Christ," George said resignedly. "Well - look, we’re gonna 
work on a ranch like the one we come from up north" 
 
 "Up north?"

answered. 
 
  "Go on," said Lennie. 
 
 George raised the gun and his hands shook, and he dropped his 
hand to the ground again. 
 
 "Go on," said Lennie. "How's it gonna be. We gonna get a little 
place." 
 
 "We'll have a cow," said George. "An' we'll have maybe a pig an' 
chickens . . . . an' down the flat we'll have a . . . . little piece alfalfa-
" 
 
 "For the rabbits," Lennie shouted. 
 
 "For the rabbits," George repeated. 
 
 "And I get to tend the rabbits."


=== Question 9 ===
What dream do George and Lennie share?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Lennie giggled happily. "I didn’t forget that, you bet." 
 
 George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his 
head, and Lennie imitated him, raising his head to see whether he 
were doing it right. "God, you’re a lot of trouble," said George. "I 
could get along so easy and so nice if I didn’t have you on my tail. I 
could live so easy and maybe have a girl." 
 
 For a moment Lennie lay quiet, and then he said hopefully, "We 
gonna work on a ranch, George."

--- Chunk 2 ---
every damn month. Get a gallon of whisky, or set in a pool room 
and play cards or shoot pool." Lennie knelt and looked over the 
fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s face was drawn with terror. 
"An’ whatta I got," George went on furiously. "I got you! You can’t 
keep a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me shovin’ all 
over the country all the time. An’ that ain’t the,' worst. You get in 
trouble. You do bad things and I got m get you out." His voice rose

--- Chunk 3 ---
"O.K. Someday - we’re gonna get the jack together and we’re 
gonna have a little house and a couple of acres an’ a cow and some 
pigs and -" 
 
 "An’ live off the fatta the lan’,"Lennie shouted. "An’ haverabbits. 
Go on, George! Tell about what we’re gonna have in the garden 
and about the rabbits in the cages and about the rain in the 
winter and the stove, and how thick the cream is an the milk like 
you can hardly cut it. Tell about that, George."

--- Chunk 4 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 5 ---
hand. He put an ace up on his scoring rack and piled a two, three 
and four of diamonds on it. "Andy's in San Quentin right now on 
account of a tart," said George. 
 
 Lennie drummed on the table with his fingers. "George?" 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "George, how long's it gonna be till we get that little place an' live 
on the fatta the lan-an' rabbits?" 
 
 "I don' know," said George. "We gotta get a big stake together. I 
know a little place we can get cheap, but they ain't givin' it away."

--- Chunk 6 ---
I wasn't drunk. I don't know if I was asleep. If some guy was with 
me, he could tell me I was asleep, an' then it would be all right. 
But I jus' don't know." Crooks was looking across the room now, 
looking toward the window. 
 
 Lennie said miserably, "George won't go away and leave me. I 
know George wun't do that." 
 
 The stable buck went on dreamily, "I remember when I was a 
little kid on my old man's chicken ranch. Had two brothers. They

--- Chunk 7 ---
Lennie choked with pride. "I can remember," he said. 
 
 George motioned with his spoon again. "Look, Lennie. I want you 
to look around here. You can remember this place, can’t you? The 
ranch is about a quarter mile up that way. Just follow the river?" 
 
 "Sure," said Lennie. "I can remember this. Di’n’t I remember 
about not gonna say a word?" 
 
 "’Course you did. Well, look Lennie - if you jus’ happen to get in 
trouble like you always done be fore, I want you to come right here

--- Chunk 8 ---
Curley's wife moved away from him a little. "I think you're nuts," 
she said. 
 
 "No I ain't," Lennie explained earnestly. "George says I ain't. I 
like to pet nice things with my fingers, sof' things. " 
 
 She was a little bit reassured. "Well, who don't?" she said. 
"Ever'body likes that. I like to feel silk an' velvet. Do you like to 
feel velvet?" 
 
 Lennie chuckled with pleasure. "You bet, by God," he cried 
happily. "An' I had some, too. A lady give me some, an' that lady

--- Chunk 9 ---
'He better not fool with Lennie if he knows what's good for 'um.' 
That's jus' what you says to me." 
 
 George turned to Lennie. "It ain't your fault," he said. "You don't 
need to be scairt no more. You done jus' what I tol' you to. Maybe 
you better go in the ' wash room an' clean up your face. You look 
like' hell." 
 
 Lennie smiled with his bruised mouth. "I didn't want no trouble," 
he said. He walked toward the door, but just before he came to it, 
he turned back. "George?"

--- Chunk 10 ---
"Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the 
world. They got no family. They don’t belong no place. They come 
to a ranch an’ work up a stake and then they go inta town and 
blow their stake, and the first thing you know they’re poundin’ 
their tail on some other ranch. They ain’t got nothing to look

 Lennie was delighted. "That’s it - that’s it. Now tell how it is with 
us." 
 
 George went on. "With us it ain’t like that. We got a future. We

--- Chunk 11 ---
was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so 
you can almost see it." 
 
 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the 
darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," 
George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of 
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined.

--- Chunk 12 ---
with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at ’em because he ain’t a big 
guy. You seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?" 
 
 "Sure," said George. "I seen plenty tough little guys. But this 
Curley better not make no mistakes about Lennie. Lennie ain’t 
handy, but this Curley punk is gonna get' hurt if he messes

--- Chunk 13 ---
indicated Lennie with his thumb. "He ain't bright. Hell of a good 
worker, though. Hell of a nice fella, but he ain't bright. I've knew 
him for a long time." 
 
 Slim looked through George and beyond him. "Ain't many guys 
travel around together," he mused. "I don't know why. Maybe 
ever'body in the whole damn world is scared of each other." 
 
 "It's a lot nicer to go around with a guy you know," said George. 
 
 A powerful, big-stomached man came into the bunk house. His

--- Chunk 14 ---
George took off his hat. He said shakily, "Take off your hat, 
Lennie. The air feels fine." 
 
 Lennie removed his hat dutifully and laid it on the ground in 
front of him. The shadow in the val-ley was bluer, and the evening 
came fast. On the wind the sound of crashing in the brush came to 
them. 
 
 Lennie said, "Tell how it's gonna be." 
 
 George had been listening to the distant sounds. For a moment he 
was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so

--- Chunk 15 ---
"For the rabbits," George repeated. 
 
 "And I get to tend the rabbits." 
 
 "An' you get to tend the rabbits." 
 
 Lennie giggled with happiness. "An' live on the fatta the lan'." 
 
 "Yes." 
 
 Lennie turned his head. 
 
 "No, Lennie. Look down there acrost the river, like you can 
almost see the place." 
 
 Lennie obeyed him. George looked down at the gun. 
 
 There were crashing footsteps in the brush now. George turned 
and looked toward them. 
 
 "Go on, George. When we gonna do it?"


=== Question 10 ===
What does George tell Lennie to do if he gets in trouble at their new job site?

--- Chunk 1 ---
every damn month. Get a gallon of whisky, or set in a pool room 
and play cards or shoot pool." Lennie knelt and looked over the 
fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s face was drawn with terror. 
"An’ whatta I got," George went on furiously. "I got you! You can’t 
keep a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me shovin’ all 
over the country all the time. An’ that ain’t the,' worst. You get in 
trouble. You do bad things and I got m get you out." His voice rose

--- Chunk 2 ---
'He better not fool with Lennie if he knows what's good for 'um.' 
That's jus' what you says to me." 
 
 George turned to Lennie. "It ain't your fault," he said. "You don't 
need to be scairt no more. You done jus' what I tol' you to. Maybe 
you better go in the ' wash room an' clean up your face. You look 
like' hell." 
 
 Lennie smiled with his bruised mouth. "I didn't want no trouble," 
he said. He walked toward the door, but just before he came to it, 
he turned back. "George?"

--- Chunk 3 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

--- Chunk 4 ---
When the sound of his footsteps had died away George turned on 
Lennie. "So you wasn’t gonna say a word. You was gonna leave 
your big flapper shut and leave me do the talkin’. Damn near lost 
us the job." 
 
 Lennie stared hopelessly at his hands. "I forgot George." 
 
 "Yeah, you forgot. You always forget, an’ I got to talk you out of 
it." He sat down heavily on. the bunk. "Now he’s got his eye on us. 
Now we got to be careful and not make no slips. You keep your big

hand. He put an ace up on his scoring rack and piled a two, three 
and four of diamonds on it. "Andy's in San Quentin right now on 
account of a tart," said George. 
 
 Lennie drummed on the table with his fingers. "George?" 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "George, how long's it gonna be till we get that little place an' live

--- Chunk 7 ---
what he's gonna do." 
 
 Now Lennie retorted belligerently, "He ain't neither. George won't 
do nothing like that. I've knew George since-1 forget when-and he 
ain't never raised his ban' to me with a stick. He's nice to me. He

 "Well, he's sick of you," said the rabbit. "He's gonna beat hell outa

 "He won't," Lennie cried frantically. "He won't do nothing like

--- Chunk 8 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my

lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes

fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing

 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 9 ---
"I never meant no harm, George. Honest I never." 
 
 "Well, you keep away from her, 'cause she's a rattrap if I ever 
seen one. You let Curley take the rap. He let himself in for it. 
Glove fulla vaseline," George said disgustedly. "An' I bet he's eatin' 
raw eggs and writin' to the patent medicine houses." 
 
 Lennie cried out suddenly-"I don' like this place, George. This 
ain't no good place. I wanna get outa here." 
 
 "We gotta keep it till we get a stake. We can't help it, Lennie.

--- Chunk 10 ---
Crooks bored in on him. "Want me to tell ya what'll happen? 
They'll take ya to the booby hatch. They'll tie ya up with a collar, 
like a dog." 
 
 Suddenly Lennie's eyes. centered and grew quiet, and mad. He 
stood up and walked dangerously toward Crooks. "Who hurt 
George?" he demanded. 
 
 Crooks saw the danger as it approached him. He edged back on 
his bunk to get out of the way. "I was just supposin'," he said. 
"George ain't hurt. He's all right. He'll be back all right."

--- Chunk 11 ---
Lennie giggled happily. "I didn’t forget that, you bet." 
 
 George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his 
head, and Lennie imitated him, raising his head to see whether he 
were doing it right. "God, you’re a lot of trouble," said George. "I 
could get along so easy and so nice if I didn’t have you on my tail. I 
could live so easy and maybe have a girl." 
 
 For a moment Lennie lay quiet, and then he said hopefully, "We 
gonna work on a ranch, George."

--- Chunk 12 ---
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George." 
 
 George got up and went over to Lennie's bunk and sat down on it. 
"I hate that kinda bastard," he said. "I seen plenty of 'em. Like the 
old guy says, Curley don't take no chances. He always wins." He 
thought for a moment. "If he tangles with you, Lennie, we're 
gonna get the can. Don't make no mistake about that. He's the 
boss's son. Look, Lennie. You try to keep away from him, will you?

--- Chunk 13 ---
up on the big guy. Never did seem right to me. Seems like Curley 
ain’t givin’ nobody a chance." 
 
 George was watching the door. He said ominously, "Well, he 
better watch out for Lennie. Lennie ain’t no fighter, but Lennie’s 
strong and quick, and Lennie don’t know no rules." He walked to 
the square table and sat down on one of the boxes. He gathered 
some of the cards together and shuffled them. 
 
 The old man sat down on another box. "Don’t tell Curley I said

--- Chunk 14 ---
"He won't do it," Lennie cried. "George wouldn't do nothing like 
that. I been with George a long time. He'll come back tonight-" But 
the doubt was too much for him. "Don't you think he will?" 
 
 Crooks' face lighted with pleasure in his torture. 
 
 "Nobody can't tell what a guy'll do," he observed calmly. "Le's say 
he wants to come back and can't. S'pose he gets killed or hurt so 
he can't come back." 
 
 Lennie struggled to understand. "George won't do nothing like

--- Chunk 15 ---
bull." 
 
 Lennie smiled to himself. "Strong as a bull," he repeated. George 
scowled at him, and Lennie dropped his head in shame at having 
forgotten. 
 
 The boss said suddenly, "Listen, Small!" Lennie raised his head. 
What can you do?" 
 
 In a panic, Lennie looked at George for help. "He can do anything 
you.tell him," said George. "He’ a good skinner. He can rassel 
grain bags, drive cultivator. He can do anything. Just give him a 
try."


=== Question 11 ===
Where do the ranch hands keep their personal belongings such as soap, razors and magazines?

--- Chunk 1 ---
them made up with blankets and the other three showing their 
burlap ticking. Over each bunk there was nailed an apple box with 
the opening forward so that it made two shelves for the personal 
belongings of the occupant of the bunk. And these shelves were 
loaded with little articles soap and talcum powder, razors and 
those Western magazines ranch men love to read and scoff at and 
secretly believe. And there were medicines on the shelves, and

 George went on. "With us it ain’t like that. We got a future. We

purty soon. Jus' as soon as I can't swamp out no bunk houses 
they'll put me on the county. Maybe if I give you guys my money, 
you'll let me hoe in the garden even after I ain't no good at it. An' 
I'll wash dishes an' little chicken stuff like that. But I'll be on our 
own place, an' I'll be let to work on our own place." He said 
miserably, "You seen what they done to my dog tonight? They says

--- Chunk 5 ---
Carlson finished the cleaning of the gun and put it in the bag and 
pushed the bag under his bunk. "I guess I'll go out and look her 
over," he said. Old Candy lay still, and Lennie, from his bunk, 
watched George cautiously. 
 
 When Whit and Carlson were gone and the door closed after 
them, George turned to Lennie. "What you got on your mind?" 
 
 "I ain't done nothing, George. Slim says I better not pet them 
pups so much for a while. Slim says it ain't good for them; so I

ranch don’t never listen nor he don’t ast no questions." 
 
 "Damn right he don’t," said George, slightly mollified, "not if he 
wants to stay. workin’ long." Rut he was reassured by the 
swamper’s defense. "Come on in and set down a minute," he said. 
"That’s a hell of an old dog." 
 
 "Yeah. I had ’im ever since he was a pup. God, he was a good 
sheep dog when he was younger." He stood his broom against the 
wall and he rubbed his white bristled cheek with his knuckles.

mess about her. She's a jail bait all set on the trigger. That Curley 
got his work cut out for him. Ranch with a bunch of guys on it 
ain't no place for a girl, specially like her." 
 
 Whit said, "If you got idears, you ought to come in town with us 
guys tomorra night." 
 
 "Why? What's doin'?" 
 
 "Jus' the usual thing. We go in to old Susy's place. Hell of a nice 
place. Old Susy's a laugh always crackin' jokes. Like she says

--- Chunk 8 ---
about that. George ain't got the money in town. That money's in 
the bank. Me an' Lennie an' George. We gonna have a room to 
ourself. We're gonna have a dog an' rabbits an' chickens. We're 
gonna have green corn an' maybe a cow or a goat." He stopped, 
overwhelmed with his picture. 
 
 Crooks asked, "You say you got the money?" 
 
 "Damn right. We got most of it. Just a little bit more to get. Have 
it all in one month. George got the land all picked out, too."

--- Chunk 9 ---
Candy said, "I ain't much good with on'y one hand. I lost my hand 
right here on this ranch. That's why they give me a job swampin'. 
An' they give me two hundred an' fifty dollars 'cause I los' my 
hand An' I got fifty more saved up right in the bank, right now. 
Tha's three hunderd, and I got fifty more comin' the end a the 
month. Tell you what-" He leaned forward eagerly. "S'pose I went 
in with you guys. Tha's three hunderd an' fifty bucks I'd put in. I

it all in one month. George got the land all picked out, too." 
 
 Crooks reached around and explored his spine with his hand. "I 
never seen a guy really do it," he said. "I seen guys nearly crazy 
with loneliness for land, but ever' time a whore house or a 
blackjack game took what it takes." He hesitated. If you . . . . guys 
would want a hand to work for nothing-just his keep, why I'd come 
an' lend a hand. I ain't so crippled I can't work like a son-of-a-bitch 
if I want to."

--- Chunk 11 ---
couple of dollars a day there, and we might hit a pocket." 
 
 Lennie leaned eagerly toward him. "Le's go, George. Le's get outta 
here. It's mean here." 
 
 "We gotta stay," George said shortly. "Shut up now. The guys'll be 
cumin' in." 
 
 From the washroom nearby came the sound of running water and 
rattling basins. George studied the cards. "Maybe we oughtta 
wash up," he said. "But we ain't done nothing to get dirty." 
 
 A tall man stood in the doorway. He held a crushed Stetson hat

--- Chunk 12 ---
What was Slim doin' in the barn when you seen him?" 
 
 "Slim?" 
 
 "Sure. You seen him in the barn, an' he tol' you not to pet the 
pups so much." 
 
 "Oh, yeah. He had a can a' tar an' a paint brush. I don't know 
what for." 
 
 "You sure that girl didn't come in like she come in here today?" 
 
 "No. She never come." 
 
 George sighed. "You give me a good whore house every time," he 
said. "A guy can go in an' get drunk and get ever'thing outa his

--- Chunk 13 ---
Lennie choked with pride. "I can remember," he said. 
 
 George motioned with his spoon again. "Look, Lennie. I want you 
to look around here. You can remember this place, can’t you? The 
ranch is about a quarter mile up that way. Just follow the river?" 
 
 "Sure," said Lennie. "I can remember this. Di’n’t I remember 
about not gonna say a word?" 
 
 "’Course you did. Well, look Lennie - if you jus’ happen to get in 
trouble like you always done be fore, I want you to come right here

--- Chunk 14 ---
Slim took his eyes from old Candy. "Huh? Oh! Hello, Crooks. 
What's'a matter?" 
 
 "You told me to warm up tar for that mule's foot. I got it warm." 
 
 "Oh! Sure, Crooks. I'll come right out an' put it on." 
 
 "I can do it if you want, Mr. Slim." 
 
 "No. I'll come do it myself." He stood up. 
 
 Crooks said, "Mr. Slim." 
 
 "Yeah." 
 
 "That big new guy's messin' around your pups out in the barn." 
 
 "Well, he ain't doin' no harm. I give him one of them pups."

--- Chunk 15 ---
canned. S'pose you do. You think we'll hit the highway an' look for 
another lousy two-bit job like this. You don't know that we got our 
own ranch to go to, an' our own house. We ain't got to stay here. 
We gotta house and chickens an' fruit trees an' a place a hunderd 
time prettier than this. An' we got fren's, that's what we got. 
Maybe there was a time when we was scared of gettin' canned, but 
we ain't no more. We got our own lan', and it's ours, an' we c'n go 
to it"


=== Question 12 ===
Candy, the old swamper who shows George and Lennie to their bunks, is missing what limb?

--- Chunk 1 ---
"Sure he's jes' like a kid. There ain't no more harm in him than a 
kid neither, except he's so strong. I bet he won't come in here to 
sleep tonight. He'd sleep right alongside that box in the barn. 
Well-let 'im. He ain't doin' no harm out there." 
 
 It was almost dark outside now. Old Candy, the swamper, came 
in and went to his bunk, and behind him struggled his old dog. 
"Hello, Slim. Hello, George. Didn't neither of you play 
horseshoes?"

--- Chunk 2 ---
wall. "You tol' me to, George," he said miserably. 
 
 Curley sat down on the floor, looking in wonder at his crushed 
hand. Slim and Carlson bent over him. Then Slim straightened up 
and regarded Lennie with horror. "We got to get him in to a 
doctor," he said. "Looks to me like ever' bone in his han' is bust." 
 
 "I didn't wanta," Lennie cried. "I didn't wanta hurt him." 
 
 Slim said, "Carlson, you get the candy wagon hitched up. We'll

--- Chunk 3 ---
Carlson finished the cleaning of the gun and put it in the bag and 
pushed the bag under his bunk. "I guess I'll go out and look her 
over," he said. Old Candy lay still, and Lennie, from his bunk, 
watched George cautiously. 
 
 When Whit and Carlson were gone and the door closed after 
them, George turned to Lennie. "What you got on your mind?" 
 
 "I ain't done nothing, George. Slim says I better not pet them 
pups so much for a while. Slim says it ain't good for them; so I

--- Chunk 4 ---
halter chains clinked. Outside, the men's voices became louder 
and clearer. 
 
 From around the end of the last stall old Candy's voice came. 
"Lennie," he called. "Oh, Lennie! You in here? 1 been figuring 
some more. Tell you what we can do, Lennie." Old Candy appeared

--- Chunk 5 ---
That dog of Candy's is so God damn old he can't hardly walk. 
Stinks like hell, too. Ever' time he comes into the bunk house I can 
smell him for two, three days. Why'n't you get Candy to shoot his 
old dog and give him one of the pups to raise up? I can smell that 
dog a mile away. Got no teeth, damn near blind, can't eat. Candy 
feeds him milk. He can't chew nothing else." 
 
 George had been staring intently at Slim. Suddenly a triangle

--- Chunk 6 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 7 ---
indicated Lennie with his thumb. "He ain't bright. Hell of a good 
worker, though. Hell of a nice fella, but he ain't bright. I've knew 
him for a long time." 
 
 Slim looked through George and beyond him. "Ain't many guys 
travel around together," he mused. "I don't know why. Maybe 
ever'body in the whole damn world is scared of each other." 
 
 "It's a lot nicer to go around with a guy you know," said George. 
 
 A powerful, big-stomached man came into the bunk house. His

--- Chunk 8 ---
team. I seen her give Slim the eye. Curley never seen it. An' I seen 
her give Carlson the eye." 
 
 George pretended a lack of interest. "Looks like we was gonna 
have fun." 
 
 The swamper stood up from his box. "Know what I think?" George 
did not answer. "Well, I think Curley's married . . . . a tart." 
 
 "He ain't the first," said George. "There's plenty done that." 
 
 The old man moved toward the door, and his ancient dog lifted his

--- Chunk 9 ---
together and turned around to Lennie. Lennie was lying down on 
the bunk watching him. 
 
 "Look, Lennie! This here ain't no set up. I'm scared. You gonna 
have trouble with that Curley guy. I seen that kind before. He was 
kinda feelin' you out. He figures he's got you scared and he's 
gonna take a sock at you the first chance he gets." 
 
 Lennie's eyes were frightened. "I don't want no trouble," he said 
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George."

--- Chunk 10 ---
and I'll come along and make like I never seen her. Will you do 
that? So the guys won't think I was in on it?" 
 
 Candy said, "Sure, George. Sure I'll do that." 
 
 "O.K. Give me a couple minutes then, and you come runnin' out 
an' tell like you jus' found her. I'm going now." George turned and 
went quickly out of the barn. 
 
 Old Candy watched him go. He looked helplessly back at Curley's 
wife, and gradually his sorrow and his anger grew into words.

--- Chunk 11 ---
'em. He promised." 
 
 Crooks interrupted brutally. "You guys is just kiddin' yourself. 
You'll talk about it a hell of a lot, but you won't get no land. You'll 
be a swamper here till they take you out in a box. Hell, I seen too 
many guys. Lennie here'll quit an' be on the road in two, three 
weeks. Seems like ever' guy got land in his head." 
 
 Candy rubbed his cheek angrily. "You God damn right we're 
gonna do it. George says we are. We got the money right now."

--- Chunk 12 ---
"The hell I ain't. Got a Luger. It won't hurt him none at all." 
 
 Candy said, "Maybe tomorra. Le's wait till tomorra." 
 
 "I don't see no reason for it," said Carlson. He went to his bunk, 
pulled his bag from underneath it and took out a Luger pistol. 
"Le's get it over with," he said. "We can't sleep with him stinkin' 
around in here." He put the pistol in his hip pocket. 
 
 Candy looked a long time at Slim to try to find some reversal. And

--- Chunk 13 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

--- Chunk 14 ---
Slim said, "Carlson, you get the candy wagon hitched up. We'll 
take 'um into Soledad an' get 'um fixed up." Carlson hurried out. 
Slim turned to the whimpering Lennie. "It ain't your fault," he sai 
"This punk sure had it comin' to him. But-Jesus! He ain't hardly 
got no han' left." Slim hurried out, and in a moment returned with 
a tin cup of water. He held it to Curley's lips. 
 
 George said, "Slim, will we get canned now? We need the stake. 
Will Curley's old man can us now?"

--- Chunk 15 ---
George moved slowly after them, and his feet dragged heavily. 
 
 And when they were gone, Candy squatted down in the hay and 
watched the face of Curley's wife. "Poor bastard," he said softly. 
 
 The sound of the men grew fainter. The barn was darkening 
gradually and, in their stalls, the horses shifted their feet and 
rattled the halter chains. Old Candy lay down in the hay and 
covered his eyes with his arm. 
 
   
 
   
 
   
 
   
 CHAPTER  6


=== Question 13 ===
What evidence does the old swamper give that the ranch boss is a “pretty nice fella”?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Curley came suddenly to life. "I know who done it," he cried. 
"That big son-of-a-bitch done it. I know he done it. Why-ever'body 
else was out there playin' horseshoes." He worked himself into a 
fury. "I'm gonna get him. I'm going for my shotgun. I'll kill the big 
son-of-a-bitch myself. I'll shoot 'im in the guts. Come on, you 
guys." He ran furiously out of the barn. Carlson said, "I'll get my 
Luger," and he ran out too.

--- Chunk 2 ---
guys." He ran furiously out of the barn. Carlson said, "I'll get my 
Luger," and he ran out too. 
 
 Slim turned quietly to George. "I guess Lennie done it, all right," 
he said. "Her neck's bust. Lennie coulda did that." 
 
 George didn't answer, but he nodded slowly. His hat was so far 
down on his forehead that his eyes were covered. 
 
 Slim went on, "Maybe like that time in Weed you was tellin' 
about." 
 
 Again George nodded.

--- Chunk 3 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

--- Chunk 4 ---
Curley said, "You go in Soledad an' get a cop. Get AI Wilts, he's 
deputy sheriff. Le's go now." He turned suspiciously on George. 
"You're comin' with us, fella." 
 
 "Yeah," said George. "I'll come. But listen, Curley. The poor 
bastard's nuts. Don't shoot 'im. He di'n't know what he was doin'." 
 
 "Don't shoot 'im?" Curley cried. "He got Carlson's Luger. 'Course 
we'll shoot 'im. " 
 
 George said weakly, "Maybe Carlson lost his gun.,,

--- Chunk 5 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

lighted on Lennie; and Lennie was still smiling with delight at the 
memory of the ranch. 
 
 Curley stepped over to Lennie like a terrier. "What the hell you 
laughin' at?" 
 
 Lennie looked blankly at him. "Huh?" 
 
 Then Curley's rage exploded. "Come on, ya big bastard. Get up on 
your feet. No big son-of-a-bitch is gonna laugh at me. I'll show ya 
who's yella." 
 
 Lennie looked helplessly at George, and then he got up and tried

George moved slowly after them, and his feet dragged heavily. 
 
 And when they were gone, Candy squatted down in the hay and 
watched the face of Curley's wife. "Poor bastard," he said softly. 
 
 The sound of the men grew fainter. The barn was darkening 
gradually and, in their stalls, the horses shifted their feet and

which were lighter than his face. 
 
 It was Saturday night. Through the open door that led into the 
barn came the sound of moving horses, of feet stirring, of teeth 
champing on hay, of the rattle of halter chains. In the stable 
buck's room a small electric globe threw a meager yellow light. 
 
 Crooks sat on his bunk. His shirt was out of his jeans in back. In 
one hand he held a bottle of liniment, and with the other he 
rubbed his spine. Now and then he poured a few drops of the

Slim came directly to George and sat down beside him, sat very 
close to him. "Never you mind," said Slim. "A guy got to 
sometimes." 
 
 But Carlson was standing over George. "How'd you do it?" he 
asked. 
 
 "I just done it," George said tiredly. 
 
 "Did he have my gun?" 
 
 "Yeah. He had your gun." 
 
 "An' you got it away from him and you took it an' you killed him?" 
 
 "Yeah. Tha's how." George's voice was almost a whisper. He

beard. And then he jumped up and went quickly out of the barn. 
 
 But the barn was alive now. The horses stamped and snorted, and 
they chewed the straw of their bedding and they clashed the 
chains of their halters. In a moment Candy came back, and 
George was with him. 
 
 George said, "What was it you wanted to see me about?" 
 
 Candy pointed at Curley's wife. George stared. "What's the 
matter with her?" he asked. He stepped closer, and then he echoed

--- Chunk 11 ---
"Yeah. Tha's how." George's voice was almost a whisper. He 
looked steadily at his right hand that had held the gun. 
 
 Slim twitched George's elbow. "Come on, George. Me an' you'll go 
in an' get a drink." 
 
 George let himself be helped to his feet. "Yeah, a drink." 
 
 Slim said, "You hadda, George. I swear you had-da. Come on with 
me." He led George into the entrance of the trail and up toward 
the highway. 
 
 Curley and Carlson looked after them. And Carlson said, "Now

singsong. And he repeated the old words: "If they was a circus or a 
baseball game . . . . we would of went to her . . . . jus' said `ta hell 
with work,' an' went to her. Never ast nobody's say so. An' they'd 
of been a pig and chickens . . . . an' in the winter . . . . the little fat 
stove . . . . an' the rain comin' . . . . an' us jus' settin' there." His 
eyes blinded with tears and he turned and went weakly out of the 
barn, and he rubbed his bristly whiskers with his wrist stump.

--- Chunk 13 ---
covered his eyes with his arm. 
 
   
 
   
 
   
 
   
 CHAPTER  6 
 
   
 
 THE deep green pool of the Salinas River was still in the late 
afternoon. Already the sun had left the valley to go climbing up 
the slopes of the Gabilan mountains, and the hilltops were rosy in 
the sun. But by the pool among the mottled sycamores, a pleasant 
shade had fallen. 
 
 A water snake glided smoothly up the pool, twist-ing its periscope 
head from side to side; and it swam the length of the pool and

answered. 
 
  "Go on," said Lennie. 
 
 George raised the gun and his hands shook, and he dropped his 
hand to the ground again. 
 
 "Go on," said Lennie. "How's it gonna be. We gonna get a little 
place." 
 
 "We'll have a cow," said George. "An' we'll have maybe a pig an' 
chickens . . . . an' down the flat we'll have a . . . . little piece alfalfa-
" 
 
 "For the rabbits," Lennie shouted. 
 
 "For the rabbits," George repeated. 
 
 "And I get to tend the rabbits."

CHAPTER  5 
 
   
 
 ONE end of the great barn was piled high with new hay and over 
the pile hung the four-taloned jackson fork suspended from its 
pulley. The hay came down like a mountain slope to the other end 
of the barn, and there was a level place as yet unfilled with the 
new crop. At the sides the feeding racks were visible, and between 
the slats the heads of horses could be seen. 
 
 It was Sunday afternoon. The resting horses nibbled the

According to the old swamper, what is Curley good at?

pretty handy. He done quite a bit in the ring. He’s a lightweight, 
and he’s handy." 
 
 "Well, let him be handy," said George, "He don’t have to take after 
Lennie. Lennie didn’t do nothing to him. What’s he got against 
Lennie?" 
 
 The swamper considered..... "Well.... tell you what. Curley’s like a 
lot of little guys. He hates big guys. He’s alla time picking scraps 
with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at ’em because he ain’t a big

The old man sat down on another box. "Don’t tell Curley I said 
none of this. He’d slough me. He just don’t give a damn. Won’t 
ever get canned ’cause his old man’s the boss." 
 
 George cut the cards and began turning them over, looking at 
each one and throwing it down on a pile. He said, "This guy Curley 
sounds like a son-of-a-bitch to me. I don’t like mean little guys." 
 
 "Seems to me like he’s worse lately," said the swamper. "He got

"How’d you like the boss?" he asked. 
 
 "Pretty good. Seemed awright." 
 
 "He’s a nice fella," the swamper agreed. "You got to take him 
right." 
 
 At that moment a young man came into the bunk house; a thin 
young man with a brown face, with brown eyes and a head of 
tightly curled hair. He wore a work glove on his left hand, and, 
like the boss, he wore high-heeled boots, "Seen my old man?" he 
asked. 
 
 The swamper said, "He was here jus’ a minute ago, Curley. Went

it. Seems like she can't keep away from guys. An' Curley's pants is

 George said, "She's gonna make a mess. They's gonna be a bad 
mess about her. She's a jail bait all set on the trigger. That Curley

open doorway. He wore blue jean trousers, a flannel shirt, a black, 
unbuttoned vest and a black coat. His thumbs were stuck in his 
belt, on each side of a square steel buckle. On his head was a 
soiled brown Stetson hat, and he wore high-heeled boots and spurs 
to prove he was not a laboring man. 
 
 The old swamper looked quickly at him, and then shuffled to the 
door rubbing his whiskers with his knuckles as he went. "Them 
guys just come," he said, and shuffled past the boss and out the

--- Chunk 7 ---
with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at ’em because he ain’t a big 
guy. You seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?" 
 
 "Sure," said George. "I seen plenty tough little guys. But this 
Curley better not make no mistakes about Lennie. Lennie ain’t 
handy, but this Curley punk is gonna get' hurt if he messes

--- Chunk 8 ---
Curley came suddenly to life. "I know who done it," he cried. 
"That big son-of-a-bitch done it. I know he done it. Why-ever'body 
else was out there playin' horseshoes." He worked himself into a 
fury. "I'm gonna get him. I'm going for my shotgun. I'll kill the big 
son-of-a-bitch myself. I'll shoot 'im in the guts. Come on, you 
guys." He ran furiously out of the barn. Carlson said, "I'll get my 
Luger," and he ran out too.

--- Chunk 9 ---
up on the big guy. Never did seem right to me. Seems like Curley 
ain’t givin’ nobody a chance." 
 
 George was watching the door. He said ominously, "Well, he 
better watch out for Lennie. Lennie ain’t no fighter, but Lennie’s 
strong and quick, and Lennie don’t know no rules." He walked to 
the square table and sat down on one of the boxes. He gathered 
some of the cards together and shuffled them. 
 
 The old man sat down on another box. "Don’t tell Curley I said

--- Chunk 10 ---
"Seems to me like he’s worse lately," said the swamper. "He got 
married a couple of weeks ago. Wife lives over in the boss’s house. 
Seems like CurIey is cockier’n ever since he got married." 
 
 George grunted, "Maybe he’s showin’ off for his wife." 
 
 The swamper warmed to his gossip. "You seen that glove on his 
left hand?" 
 
 "Yeah. I seen it." 
 
 "Well, that glove’s fulla vaseline." 
 
 "Vaseline? What the hell for?"

--- Chunk 11 ---
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George." 
 
 George got up and went over to Lennie's bunk and sat down on it. 
"I hate that kinda bastard," he said. "I seen plenty of 'em. Like the 
old guy says, Curley don't take no chances. He always wins." He 
thought for a moment. "If he tangles with you, Lennie, we're 
gonna get the can. Don't make no mistake about that. He's the 
boss's son. Look, Lennie. You try to keep away from him, will you?

--- Chunk 12 ---
mess about her. She's a jail bait all set on the trigger. That Curley 
got his work cut out for him. Ranch with a bunch of guys on it 
ain't no place for a girl, specially like her." 
 
 Whit said, "If you got idears, you ought to come in town with us 
guys tomorra night." 
 
 "Why? What's doin'?" 
 
 "Jus' the usual thing. We go in to old Susy's place. Hell of a nice 
place. Old Susy's a laugh always crackin' jokes. Like she says

--- Chunk 13 ---
looked sullenly up at her.She said, "What you got there, sonny 
boy?" 
 
 Lennie glared at her. "George says I ain't to have nothing to do 
with you-talk to you or nothing." 
 
 She laughed "George giving you orders about everything?" 
 
 Lennie looked down at the hay. "Says I can't tend no rabbits if I 
talk to you or anything." 
 
 She said quietly, "He's scared Curley'll get mad. Well, Curley got 
his arm in a sling-an' if Curley gets tough, you can break his other

--- Chunk 14 ---
"Sure he's jes' like a kid. There ain't no more harm in him than a 
kid neither, except he's so strong. I bet he won't come in here to 
sleep tonight. He'd sleep right alongside that box in the barn. 
Well-let 'im. He ain't doin' no harm out there." 
 
 It was almost dark outside now. Old Candy, the swamper, came 
in and went to his bunk, and behind him struggled his old dog. 
"Hello, Slim. Hello, George. Didn't neither of you play 
horseshoes?"

--- Chunk 15 ---
an' lend a hand. I ain't so crippled I can't work like a son-of-a-bitch 
if I want to." 
 
 "Any you boys seen Curley?" 
 
 They swung their heads toward the door. Looking in was Curley's 
wife. Her face was heavily made up. Her lips were slightly parted. 
She breathed strongly, as though she had been running. 
 
 "Curley ain't been here," Candy said sourly. 
 
 She stood still in the doorway, smiling a little at them, rubbing 
the nails of one hand with the thumb and forefinger of the other.


=== Question 16 ===
According to the old swamper, why does Curley wear a work glove on his left hand?

--- Chunk 1 ---
open doorway. He wore blue jean trousers, a flannel shirt, a black, 
unbuttoned vest and a black coat. His thumbs were stuck in his 
belt, on each side of a square steel buckle. On his head was a 
soiled brown Stetson hat, and he wore high-heeled boots and spurs 
to prove he was not a laboring man. 
 
 The old swamper looked quickly at him, and then shuffled to the 
door rubbing his whiskers with his knuckles as he went. "Them 
guys just come," he said, and shuffled past the boss and out the

--- Chunk 2 ---
pretty handy. He done quite a bit in the ring. He’s a lightweight, 
and he’s handy." 
 
 "Well, let him be handy," said George, "He don’t have to take after 
Lennie. Lennie didn’t do nothing to him. What’s he got against 
Lennie?" 
 
 The swamper considered..... "Well.... tell you what. Curley’s like a 
lot of little guys. He hates big guys. He’s alla time picking scraps 
with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at ’em because he ain’t a big

--- Chunk 3 ---
"How’d you like the boss?" he asked. 
 
 "Pretty good. Seemed awright." 
 
 "He’s a nice fella," the swamper agreed. "You got to take him 
right." 
 
 At that moment a young man came into the bunk house; a thin 
young man with a brown face, with brown eyes and a head of 
tightly curled hair. He wore a work glove on his left hand, and, 
like the boss, he wore high-heeled boots, "Seen my old man?" he 
asked. 
 
 The swamper said, "He was here jus’ a minute ago, Curley. Went

--- Chunk 4 ---
"Seems to me like he’s worse lately," said the swamper. "He got 
married a couple of weeks ago. Wife lives over in the boss’s house. 
Seems like CurIey is cockier’n ever since he got married." 
 
 George grunted, "Maybe he’s showin’ off for his wife." 
 
 The swamper warmed to his gossip. "You seen that glove on his 
left hand?" 
 
 "Yeah. I seen it." 
 
 "Well, that glove’s fulla vaseline." 
 
 "Vaseline? What the hell for?"

--- Chunk 5 ---
The old man sat down on another box. "Don’t tell Curley I said 
none of this. He’d slough me. He just don’t give a damn. Won’t 
ever get canned ’cause his old man’s the boss." 
 
 George cut the cards and began turning them over, looking at 
each one and throwing it down on a pile. He said, "This guy Curley 
sounds like a son-of-a-bitch to me. I don’t like mean little guys." 
 
 "Seems to me like he’s worse lately," said the swamper. "He got

--- Chunk 6 ---
team. I seen her give Slim the eye. Curley never seen it. An' I seen 
her give Carlson the eye." 
 
 George pretended a lack of interest. "Looks like we was gonna 
have fun." 
 
 The swamper stood up from his box. "Know what I think?" George 
did not answer. "Well, I think Curley's married . . . . a tart." 
 
 "He ain't the first," said George. "There's plenty done that." 
 
 The old man moved toward the door, and his ancient dog lifted his

--- Chunk 7 ---
Curley came suddenly to life. "I know who done it," he cried. 
"That big son-of-a-bitch done it. I know he done it. Why-ever'body 
else was out there playin' horseshoes." He worked himself into a 
fury. "I'm gonna get him. I'm going for my shotgun. I'll kill the big 
son-of-a-bitch myself. I'll shoot 'im in the guts. Come on, you 
guys." He ran furiously out of the barn. Carlson said, "I'll get my 
Luger," and he ran out too.

--- Chunk 8 ---
buttoned it, and his black hat was pulled down low over his eyes. 
The men raced around the last stall. Their eyes found Curley's 
wife in the gloom, they stopped and stood still and looked. 
 
 Then Slim went quietly over to her, and he felt her wrist. One 
lean finger touched her cheek, and then his hand went under her 
slightly twisted neck and his fingers explored her neck. When he 
stood up the men crowded near and the spell was broken.

--- Chunk 9 ---
with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at ’em because he ain’t a big 
guy. You seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?" 
 
 "Sure," said George. "I seen plenty tough little guys. But this 
Curley better not make no mistakes about Lennie. Lennie ain’t

--- Chunk 10 ---
an' lend a hand. I ain't so crippled I can't work like a son-of-a-bitch 
if I want to." 
 
 "Any you boys seen Curley?" 
 
 They swung their heads toward the door. Looking in was Curley's 
wife. Her face was heavily made up. Her lips were slightly parted. 
She breathed strongly, as though she had been running. 
 
 "Curley ain't been here," Candy said sourly. 
 
 She stood still in the doorway, smiling a little at them, rubbing 
the nails of one hand with the thumb and forefinger of the other.

--- Chunk 11 ---
"Says ‘positively kills lice, roaches and other:, scourges.’ What the 
hell kind of bed you giving us, anyways. We don’t want no pants 
rabbits." 
 
 The old swamper shifted his broom and held it between his elbow 
and his side while he held out his hand for the can. He studied the 
label carefully. "Tell you what -" he said finally, "last guy that 
hadthis bed was a blacksmith - hell of a nice fella and clean a guy 
as you want to meet. Used to wash his hands evenafter he ate."

--- Chunk 12 ---
up on the big guy. Never did seem right to me. Seems like Curley 
ain’t givin’ nobody a chance." 
 
 George was watching the door. He said ominously, "Well, he 
better watch out for Lennie. Lennie ain’t no fighter, but Lennie’s 
strong and quick, and Lennie don’t know no rules." He walked to 
the square table and sat down on one of the boxes. He gathered

 The old man sat down on another box. "Don’t tell Curley I said

 George got up and went over to Lennie's bunk and sat down on it.

boss's son. Look, Lennie. You try to keep away from him, will you?

--- Chunk 14 ---
ranch don’t never listen nor he don’t ast no questions." 
 
 "Damn right he don’t," said George, slightly mollified, "not if he 
wants to stay. workin’ long." Rut he was reassured by the 
swamper’s defense. "Come on in and set down a minute," he said. 
"That’s a hell of an old dog." 
 
 "Yeah. I had ’im ever since he was a pup. God, he was a good 
sheep dog when he was younger." He stood his broom against the 
wall and he rubbed his white bristled cheek with his knuckles.

--- Chunk 15 ---
rubbed his spine. Now and then he poured a few drops of the 
liniment into his pink-palmed hand and reached up under his 
shirt to rub again. He flexed his muscles against his back and 
shivered. 
 
 Noiselessly Lennie appeared in the open doorway and stood there 
looking in, his big shoulders nearly filling the opening. For a 
moment Crooks did not see him, but on raising his eyes he 
stiffened and a scowl came on his face. His hand came out from 
under his shirt.


=== Question 17 ===
What is the general attitude toward Curley's wife?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Curley's wife moved away from him a little. "I think you're nuts," 
she said. 
 
 "No I ain't," Lennie explained earnestly. "George says I ain't. I 
like to pet nice things with my fingers, sof' things. " 
 
 She was a little bit reassured. "Well, who don't?" she said. 
"Ever'body likes that. I like to feel silk an' velvet. Do you like to 
feel velvet?" 
 
 Lennie chuckled with pleasure. "You bet, by God," he cried 
happily. "An' I had some, too. A lady give me some, an' that lady

--- Chunk 2 ---
got that letter," she said. "I always thought my of lady stole it. 
Well, I wasn't gonna stay no place where I couldn't get nowhere or 
make something of myself, an' where they stole your letters. I ast 
her if she stole it, too, an' she says no. So I married Curley. Met 
him out to the Riverside Dance Palace that same night." She 
demanded, "You listenin'?" 
 
 "Me? Sure." 
 
 "Well, I ain't told this to nobody before. Maybe I ought'n to. I

--- Chunk 3 ---
Curley's got yella-jackets in his drawers, but that's all so far. Ever' 
time the guys is around she shows up. She's lookin' for Curley, or 
she thought she lef' sotnethin' layin' around and she's lookin' for 
it. Seems like she can't keep away from guys. An' Curley's pants is 
just crawlin' with ants, but they ain't nothing come of it yet." 
 
 George said, "She's gonna make a mess. They's gonna be a bad 
mess about her. She's a jail bait all set on the trigger. That Curley

--- Chunk 4 ---
Slim said, "Well, you been askin' me too often. I'm gettin' God 
damn sick of it. If you can't look after your own God damn wife, 
what you expect me to do about it? You lay offa me." 
 
 "I'm jus' tryin' to tell you I didn't mean nothing," said Curley. "I 
jus' thought you might of saw her." 
 
 "Why'n't you tell her to stay the hell home where she belongs?" 
said Carlson. "You let her hang around bunk houses and pretty 
soon you're gonna have som'pin on your hands and you won't be

--- Chunk 5 ---
bunk house, and she hurried away. 
 
 George looked around at Lennie. "Jesus, what a tramp," he said. 
"So that's what Curley picks for a wife." 
 
 "She's purty," said Lennie defensively. 
 
 "Yeah, and she's sure hidin' it. Curley got his work ahead of him. 
Bet she'd clear out for twenty bucks." 
 
 Lennie still stared at the doorway where she had been. "Gosh, she 
was purty." He smiled admiringly. George looked quickly down at 
him and then he took him by an ear and shook him.

--- Chunk 6 ---
"Me? Sure." 
 
 "Well, I ain't told this to nobody before. Maybe I ought'n to. I 
don'like Curley. He ain't a nice fella." And because she had 
confided in him, she moved closer to Lennie and sat beside him. 
"Coulda been in the movies, an' had nice clothes-all them nice

--- Chunk 7 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 8 ---
pretty handy. He done quite a bit in the ring. He’s a lightweight, 
and he’s handy." 
 
 "Well, let him be handy," said George, "He don’t have to take after 
Lennie. Lennie didn’t do nothing to him. What’s he got against 
Lennie?" 
 
 The swamper considered..... "Well.... tell you what. Curley’s like a 
lot of little guys. He hates big guys. He’s alla time picking scraps 
with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at ’em because he ain’t a big

--- Chunk 9 ---
along her spine. She whimpered and cringed to the packing box, 
and jumped in among the puppies. 
 
 Curley's wife lay with a half-covering of yellow hay. And the 
meanness and the plannings and the discontent and the ache for 
attention were all gone from her face. She was very pretty and 
simple, and her face was sweet and young. Now her rouged cheeks 
and her reddened lips made her seem alive and sleeping very 
lightly. The curls, tiny little sausages, were spread on the hay

--- Chunk 10 ---
George." 
 
 Curley's wife came around the end of the last stall. She came very 
quietly, so that Lennie didn't see her. She wore her bright cotton 
dress and the mules with the red ostrich feathers. Her face was 
made up and the little sausage curls were all in place. She was 
quite near to him before Lennie looked up and saw her. 
 
 In a panic he shoveled hay over the puppy with his fingers. He 
looked sullenly up at her.She said, "What you got there, sonny 
boy?"

--- Chunk 11 ---
looked sullenly up at her.She said, "What you got there, sonny 
boy?" 
 
 Lennie glared at her. "George says I ain't to have nothing to do 
with you-talk to you or nothing." 
 
 She laughed "George giving you orders about everything?" 
 
 Lennie looked down at the hay. "Says I can't tend no rabbits if I 
talk to you or anything." 
 
 She said quietly, "He's scared Curley'll get mad. Well, Curley got 
his arm in a sling-an' if Curley gets tough, you can break his other

--- Chunk 12 ---
an' lend a hand. I ain't so crippled I can't work like a son-of-a-bitch 
if I want to." 
 
 "Any you boys seen Curley?" 
 
 They swung their heads toward the door. Looking in was Curley's 
wife. Her face was heavily made up. Her lips were slightly parted. 
She breathed strongly, as though she had been running. 
 
 "Curley ain't been here," Candy said sourly. 
 
 She stood still in the doorway, smiling a little at them, rubbing 
the nails of one hand with the thumb and forefinger of the other.

--- Chunk 13 ---
But Candy said excitedly, "We oughtta let'im get away. You don't 
know that Curley. Curley gon'ta wanta get 'im lynched. Curley'll 
get 'im killed." 
 
 George watched Candy's lips. "Yeah," he said at last, "that's right, 
Curley will. An' the other guys will." And he looked back at 
Curley's wife. 
 
 Now Candy spoke his greatest fear. "You an' me can get that little 
place, can't we, George? You an' me can go there an' live nice, can't 
we, George? Can't we?"

--- Chunk 14 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

--- Chunk 15 ---
buttoned it, and his black hat was pulled down low over his eyes. 
The men raced around the last stall. Their eyes found Curley's 
wife in the gloom, they stopped and stood still and looked. 
 
 Then Slim went quietly over to her, and he felt her wrist. One 
lean finger touched her cheek, and then his hand went under her 
slightly twisted neck and his fingers explored her neck. When he 
stood up the men crowded near and the spell was broken.


=== Question 18 ===
Describe Slim, the jerkline skinner.

--- Chunk 1 ---
line to the leaders. He was capable of killing a fly on the wheeler's 
butt with a bull whip without touching the mule. There was a 
gravity in his manner and a quiet so profound that all talk 
stopped when he spoke. His authority was so great that his word 
was taken on any subject, be it politics or love. This was Slim, the 
jerkline skinner. His hatchet face was ageless. He might have 
been thirty-five or fifty. His ear heard more than was said to him,

--- Chunk 2 ---
"All right. But don’t try to put nothing over, ’cause you can’t get 
away with nothing. I seen wise guys before. Go on out with the 
grain teams after dinner. They’re pickin’ up barley at the 
threshing machine. Go out with Slim’s team." 
 
 "Slim?" 
 
 "Yeah. Big tall skinner. You’ll see him at dinner." He turned 
abruptly and went to the door, but before he went out he turned 
and looked for a long moment at the two men. 
 
 When the sound of his footsteps had died away George turned on

--- Chunk 3 ---
"'Course he ain't mean. But he gets in trouble alla time because 
he's so God damn dumb. Like what happened in Weed-" he 
stopped, stopped in the middle of turning over a card. He looked 
alarmed and peered over at Slim. "You wouldn't tell nobody?" 
 
 "What'd he do in Weed?" Slim asked calmly. 
 
 "You wouldn' tell? . . . . No, 'course you wouldn'." 
 
 "What'd he do in Weed?" Slim asked again. 
 
 "Well, he seen this girl in a red dress. Dumb bastard like he is, he

--- Chunk 4 ---
Slim smiled wryly. He knelt down beside Curley. "You got your 
senses in hand enough to listen?" he asked. Curley nodded. "Well, 
then listen," Slim went on. "I think you got your han' caught in a 
machine. If you don't tell nobody what happened, we ain't going to. 
But you jus' tell an' try to get this guy canned and we'll tell 
ever'body, an' then will you get' the laugh." 
 
 "I won't tell," said Curley. He avoided looking at Lennie.

--- Chunk 5 ---
Candy quickly changed the subject. "Slim's as good a skinner as I 
ever seen." 
 
 Lennie leaned toward the old swamper "About them rabbits," he 
insisted. 
 
 Candy smiled. "I got it figured out. We can make some money on 
them rabbits if we go about it right." 
 
 "But I get to tend'em," Lennie broke in. "George says I get to tend 
'em. He promised." 
 
 Crooks interrupted brutally. "You guys is just kiddin' yourself.

--- Chunk 6 ---
"Hello, Slim. Hello, George. Didn't neither of you play 
horseshoes?" 
 
 "I don't like to play ever' night," said Slim. 
 
 Candy went on, "Either you guys got a slug of whisky? I gotta gut 
ache." 
 
 "I ain't," said Slim. "I'd drink it myself if I had, an' I ain't got a 
gut ache neither."

--- Chunk 7 ---
Candy looked a long time at Slim to try to find some reversal. And 
Slim gave him none. At last Candy said softly and hopelessly, 
"Awright--take 'im." He did not look down at the dog at all. He lay 
back on his bunk and crossed his arms behind his head and stared

--- Chunk 8 ---
guy." 
 
 George spoke proudly. "Jus' tell Lennie what to do an' he'll do it if 
it don't take no figuring. He can't think of nothing to do himself, 
but he sure can take orders." 
 
 There was a clang of horseshoe on iron stake outside and a little 
cheer of voices. 
 
 Slim moved back slightly so the light was not on his face. "Funny 
how you an' him string along together." It was Slim's calm 
invitation to confidence. 
 
 "What's funny about it?" George demanded defensively.

--- Chunk 9 ---
under his arm while he combed his long, black, damp hair straight 
back. Like the others he wore blue jeans and a short denim jacket. 
When he had finished combing his hair he moved into the room, 
and he moved with a majesty only achieved by royalty and master 
craftsmen. He was a jerkline skinner, the prince of the ranch, 
capable of driving ten, sixteen, even twenty mules with a single 
line to the leaders. He was capable of killing a fly on the wheeler's

--- Chunk 10 ---
deliberately. "Purty?" he asked casually. 
 
 "Yeah. Purty . . . . but-" 
 
 George studied his cards. "But what?" 
 
 "Well--she got the eye." 
 
 "Yeah? Married two weeks and got the eye? Maybe that's why 
Curley's pants is full of ants." 
 
 "I seen her give Slim the eye. Slim's a jerkline skinner. Hell of a 
nice fella. Slim don't need to wear no high-heeled boots on a grain 
team. I seen her give Slim the eye. Curley never seen it. An' I seen 
her give Carlson the eye."

--- Chunk 11 ---
around with Lennie." 
 
 "Well, Curley’s pretty handy," the swamper said skeptically. 
"Never did seem right to me. S'pose Curley jumps a big guy an’ 
licks him. Ever’body says what a game guy Curley is. And s’pose 
he does the same thing and gets licked. Then ever’body says the 
big guy oughtta pick somebody his own size, and maybe they gang 
up on the big guy. Never did seem right to me. Seems like Curley 
ain’t givin’ nobody a chance."

--- Chunk 12 ---
"Just thought I'd tell ya," said Crooks. "He's takin' 'em outs the 
nest and handlin' them. That won't do them no good." 
 
 "He won't hurt 'em," said Slim. "I'll come along with you now." 
 
 George looked up. "If that crazy bastard's foolin' around too much, 
jus' kick him out, Slim." 
 
 Slim followed the stable buck out of the room. 
 
 George dealt and Whit picked up his cards and examined them. 
"Seen the new kid yet?" he asked. 
 
 "What kid?" George asked.

--- Chunk 13 ---
it's swell." 
 
 Lennie broke in, "You said about them rabbits." 
 
 Candy leaned against the wall beside the broken collar while he 
scratched the wrist stump. "I been here a long time," he said. "An' 
Crooks been here a long time. This's the first time I ever been in 
his room." 
 
 Crooks said darkly, "Guys don't come into a colored man's room 
very much. Nobody been here but Slim. Slim an' the boss." 
 
 Candy quickly changed the subject. "Slim's as good a skinner as I 
ever seen."

--- Chunk 14 ---
Slim reached up over the card table and turned on the tin-shaded 
electric light. Instantly the table was brilliant with light, and the 
cone of the shade threw its brightness straight downward, leaving 
the corners of the bunk house still in dusk. Slim sat down on a box 
and George took his place opposite. 
 
 "It wasn't nothing," said Slim. "I would of had to drowned most of 
'em anyways. No need to thank me about that." 
 
 George said, "It wasn't much to you, maybe, but it was a hell of a

--- Chunk 15 ---
soon you're gonna have som'pin on your hands and you won't be 
able to do nothing about it." 
 
 Curley whirled on Carlson. "You keep outta this les' you wanta 
step outside." 
 
 Carlson laughed. "You God damn punk," he said. "You tried to 
throw a scare into Slim, an' you couldn't make it stick. Slim 
throwed a scare inta you. You're yella as a frog belly. I don't care if 
you're the best welter in the country. You come for me, an' I'll kick 
your God damn head off."


=== Question 19 ===
Why does Carlson suggest shooting Candy's dog?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Candy looked about unhappily. "No," he said softly. "No, I 
couldn't do that. I had 'im too long." 
 
 "He don't have no fun," Carlson insisted. "And he stinks to beat 
hell. Tell you what. I'll shoot him for you. Then it won't be you 
that does it." 
 
 Candy threw his legs off his bunk. He scratched the white stubble 
whiskers on his check nervously. 
 
   
 
 "I'm so used to him," he said softly. "I had him from a pup."

--- Chunk 2 ---
That dog of Candy's is so God damn old he can't hardly walk. 
Stinks like hell, too. Ever' time he comes into the bunk house I can 
smell him for two, three days. Why'n't you get Candy to shoot his 
old dog and give him one of the pups to raise up? I can smell that 
dog a mile away. Got no teeth, damn near blind, can't eat. Candy 
feeds him milk. He can't chew nothing else." 
 
 George had been staring intently at Slim. Suddenly a triangle

--- Chunk 3 ---
"Don't tell nobody," Lennie said to himself. 
 
 Candy said, "George." 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "I ought to of shot that dog myself, George. I shouldn't ought to of 
let no stranger shoot my dog." 
 
 The door opened. Slim came in, followed by Curley and Carlson 
and Whit. Slim's hands were black with tar and he was scowling. 
Curley hung close to his elbow. 
 
 Curley said, "Well, I didn't mean nothing, Slim. I just ast you." 
 
 Slim said, "Well, you been askin' me too often. I'm gettin' God

--- Chunk 4 ---
Carlson finished the cleaning of the gun and put it in the bag and 
pushed the bag under his bunk. "I guess I'll go out and look her 
over," he said. Old Candy lay still, and Lennie, from his bunk, 
watched George cautiously. 
 
 When Whit and Carlson were gone and the door closed after 
them, George turned to Lennie. "What you got on your mind?" 
 
 "I ain't done nothing, George. Slim says I better not pet them 
pups so much for a while. Slim says it ain't good for them; so I

the ancient dog, and he apologized, "I been around him so much I 
never notice how he stinks." 
 
 "Well, I can't stand him in here," said Carlson. "That stink hangs 
around even after he's gone." He walked over with his heavy-
legged stride and looked down at the dog. "Got no teeth," he said. 
"He's all stiff with rheumatism. He ain't no good to you, Candy. 
An' he ain't no good to himself. Why'n't you shoot him, Candy?" 
 
 The old man squirmed uncomfortably. "Well-hell! I had him so

--- Chunk 6 ---
at the ceiling. 
 
 From his pocket Carlson took a little leather thong. He stooped 
over and tied it around the old dog's neck. All the men except 
Candy watched him. 
 
 "Come boy. Come on, boy," he said gently. And he said 
apologetically to Candy, "He won't even feel it." Candy did not 
move nor answer him. He twitched the thong. "Come on, boy." The 
old dog got slowly and stiffly to his feet and followed the gently 
pulling leash. 
 
 Slim said, "Carlson." 
 
 "Yeah?"

--- Chunk 7 ---
found a little cleaning rod in the bag and a can of oil. He laid them 
on his bed and then brought out the pistol, took out the magazine 
and snapped the loaded shell from the chamber. Then he fell to 
cleaning the barrel with the little rod. When the ejector snapped, 
Candy turned over and looked for a moment at the gun before he 
turned back to the wall again. 
 
 Carlson said casually, "Curley been in yet?" 
 
   
 
 "No," said Whit. "What's eatin' on Curley?"

--- Chunk 8 ---
"He's plenty good," said Slim. 
 
 "Damn right he is," said Carlson. "He don't give nobody else a 
chance to win-" He stopped and sniffed the air, and still sniffing, 
looked down at the old dog. "God awmighty, that dog stinks. Get 
him outa here, Candy! I don't know nothing that stinks as bad as 
an old dog. You gotta get him out." 
 
 Candy rolled to the edge of his bunk. He reached over and patted 
the ancient dog, and he apologized, "I been around him so much I

--- Chunk 9 ---
"I'm so used to him," he said softly. "I had him from a pup." 
 
 "Well, you ain't bein' kind to him keepin' him alive," said Carlson. 
"Look, Slim's bitch got a litter right now. I bet Slim would give you 
one of them pnps to raise up, wouldn't you, Slim?" 
 
 The skinner had been studying the old dog with his calm eyes. 
"Yeah," he said. "You can have a pup if you want to." He seemed to 
shake himself free for speech. "Carl's right, Candy. That dog ain't

--- Chunk 10 ---
"The hell I ain't. Got a Luger. It won't hurt him none at all." 
 
 Candy said, "Maybe tomorra. Le's wait till tomorra." 
 
 "I don't see no reason for it," said Carlson. He went to his bunk, 
pulled his bag from underneath it and took out a Luger pistol. 
"Le's get it over with," he said. "We can't sleep with him stinkin' 
around in here." He put the pistol in his hip pocket. 
 
 Candy looked a long time at Slim to try to find some reversal. And

--- Chunk 11 ---
we'll shoot 'im. " 
 
 George said weakly, "Maybe Carlson lost his gun.,, 
 
 "I seen it this morning," said Carlson. "No, it's been took." 
 
 Slim stood looking down at Curley's wife. He said, "Curley-maybe 
you better stay here with your wife." 
 
 Curley's face reddened. "I'm goin'," he said. "I'm gonna shoot the 
guts outa that big bastard myself, even if I only got one hand. I'm 
gonna get 'im." 
 
 Slim turned to Candy. "You stay here with her then, Candy. The

--- Chunk 12 ---
"Yeah, five. I kept the biggest" 
 
 "What kinda dogs you think they're gonna be?" 
 
 "I dunno," said Slim. "Some kinda shepherds, I guess. That's the 
most kind I seen around here when she was in heat." 
 
 Carlson went on, "Got five pups, huh. Gonna keep all of 'em?" 
 
 "I dunno. Have to keep 'em a while so they can drink Lulu's milk." 
 
 Carlson said thoughtfully, "Well, looka here, Slim. I been thinkin'. 
That dog of Candy's is so God damn old he can't hardly walk.

--- Chunk 13 ---
outside. He crouched down in the hay and listened. "I done a real 
bad thing," he said. "I shouldn't of did that. George'll be mad. An' . 
. . . he said . . . . an' hide in the brush till he come. He's gonna be 
mad. In the brush till he come. Tha's what he said." Lennie went-
back and looked at the dead girl. The puppy lay close to her. 
Lennie picked it up. "I'll throw him away," he said. "It's bad 
enough like it is." He put the pup under his coat, and he crept to

--- Chunk 14 ---
But Candy said excitedly, "We oughtta let'im get away. You don't 
know that Curley. Curley gon'ta wanta get 'im lynched. Curley'll 
get 'im killed." 
 
 George watched Candy's lips. "Yeah," he said at last, "that's right, 
Curley will. An' the other guys will." And he looked back at 
Curley's wife. 
 
 Now Candy spoke his greatest fear. "You an' me can get that little 
place, can't we, George? You an' me can go there an' live nice, can't 
we, George? Can't we?"

--- Chunk 15 ---
Maybe you wouldn’t killit. That’d be better than. mice. And you 
could pet it harder." 
 
 Lennie avoided the bait. He had sensed his advantage, "If you 
don’t want me, you only jus’ got to say so, and I’ll go off in those 
hills right there - right up in those hills and live by myself. An’ I 
won’t get no mice stole from me." 
 
 George said, "I want you to stay with me, Lennie. Jesus Christ, 
somebody’d shoot you for a coyote if you was by yourself. No, you


=== Question 20 ===
What is the understood question that Lennie wants George to ask Slim?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Slim is. But I like to see the fuss if it comes off. Come on, le's go." 
 
 George said, "I'm stayin' right here. I don't want to get mixed up 
in nothing. Lennie and me got to make a stake."

--- Chunk 2 ---
Lennie, who had been following the conversation back and forth 
with his eyes, smiled complacency at the compliment. Slim looked 
approvingly at George for having given the compliment. He leaned 
over the table and snapped the corner of a loose card. "You guys 
travel around together?" His tone was friendly. It invited 
confidence without demanding it. 
 
 "Sure," said George. "We kinda look after each other." He 
indicated Lennie with his thumb. "He ain't bright. Hell of a good

--- Chunk 3 ---
no fun. After a long time they get mean. They get wantin' to fight 
all the time. 
 
 "Yeah, they get mean," Slim agreed. "They get so they don't want 
to talk to nobody." 
 
 "'Course Lennie's a God damn nuisance most of the time," said 
George. "But you get used to goin' around with a guy an' you can't 
get rid of him." 
 
 "He ain't mean," said Slim. "I can see Lennie ain't a bit mean." 
 
 "'Course he ain't mean. But he gets in trouble alla time because

--- Chunk 4 ---
guys." He ran furiously out of the barn. Carlson said, "I'll get my 
Luger," and he ran out too. 
 
 Slim turned quietly to George. "I guess Lennie done it, all right," 
he said. "Her neck's bust. Lennie coulda did that." 
 
 George didn't answer, but he nodded slowly. His hat was so far 
down on his forehead that his eyes were covered. 
 
 Slim went on, "Maybe like that time in Weed you was tellin' 
about." 
 
 Again George nodded.

--- Chunk 5 ---
with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at ’em because he ain’t a big 
guy. You seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?" 
 
 "Sure," said George. "I seen plenty tough little guys. But this 
Curley better not make no mistakes about Lennie. Lennie ain’t 
handy, but this Curley punk is gonna get' hurt if he messes

--- Chunk 6 ---
indicated Lennie with his thumb. "He ain't bright. Hell of a good 
worker, though. Hell of a nice fella, but he ain't bright. I've knew 
him for a long time." 
 
 Slim looked through George and beyond him. "Ain't many guys 
travel around together," he mused. "I don't know why. Maybe 
ever'body in the whole damn world is scared of each other." 
 
 "It's a lot nicer to go around with a guy you know," said George. 
 
 A powerful, big-stomached man came into the bunk house. His

--- Chunk 7 ---
"Curley's just spoilin' or he wouldn't start for Slim. An' Curley's 
handy, God damn handy. Got in the finals for the Golden Gloves. 
He got newspaper clippings about it." He considered. "But jus' the 
same, he better leave Slim alone. Nobody don't know what Slim 
can do." 
 
 "Thinks Slim's with his wife, don't he?" said George. 
 
 "Looks like it," Whit said. "'Course Slim ain't. Least I don't think 
Slim is. But I like to see the fuss if it comes off. Come on, le's go."

--- Chunk 8 ---
sat down at the table, across from George. Almost automatically 
George shuffled the cards and laid out his solitaire hand. He used 
a deliberate, thoughtful, slowness. 
 
 Lennie reached for a face card and studied it, then turned it 
upside down and studied it. "Both ends the same," he said. 
"George, why is it both end's the same?" 
 
 "I don't know," said George. "That's jus' the way they make 'em. 
What was Slim doin' in the barn when you seen him?" 
 
 "Slim?"

--- Chunk 9 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 10 ---
Lennie giggled happily. "I didn’t forget that, you bet." 
 
 George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his 
head, and Lennie imitated him, raising his head to see whether he 
were doing it right. "God, you’re a lot of trouble," said George. "I 
could get along so easy and so nice if I didn’t have you on my tail. I 
could live so easy and maybe have a girl." 
 
 For a moment Lennie lay quiet, and then he said hopefully, "We 
gonna work on a ranch, George."

--- Chunk 11 ---
Slim came directly to George and sat down beside him, sat very 
close to him. "Never you mind," said Slim. "A guy got to 
sometimes." 
 
 But Carlson was standing over George. "How'd you do it?" he 
asked. 
 
 "I just done it," George said tiredly. 
 
 "Did he have my gun?" 
 
 "Yeah. He had your gun." 
 
 "An' you got it away from him and you took it an' you killed him?" 
 
 "Yeah. Tha's how." George's voice was almost a whisper. He

wall. "You tol' me to, George," he said miserably. 
 
 Curley sat down on the floor, looking in wonder at his crushed 
hand. Slim and Carlson bent over him. Then Slim straightened up 
and regarded Lennie with horror. "We got to get him in to a 
doctor," he said. "Looks to me like ever' bone in his han' is bust." 
 
 "I didn't wanta," Lennie cried. "I didn't wanta hurt him." 
 
 Slim said, "Carlson, you get the candy wagon hitched up. We'll

hand. He put an ace up on his scoring rack and piled a two, three 
and four of diamonds on it. "Andy's in San Quentin right now on 
account of a tart," said George. 
 
 Lennie drummed on the table with his fingers. "George?" 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "George, how long's it gonna be till we get that little place an' live 
on the fatta the lan-an' rabbits?" 
 
 "I don' know," said George. "We gotta get a big stake together. I 
know a little place we can get cheap, but they ain't givin' it away."

--- Chunk 14 ---
he asked finally. 
 
 "Hell, no. He just scared her. I'd be scared too if he grabbed me. 
But he never hurt her. He jus' wanted to touch that red dress, like 
he wants to pet them pups all the time." 
 
 "He ain't mean," said Slim. "I can tell a mean guy a mile off." 
 
 "'Course he ain't, and he'll do any damn thing I-" 
 
 Lennie came in through the door. He wore his blue denim coat 
over his shoulders like a cape, and he walked hunched way over.

--- Chunk 15 ---
"The one that his old lady used to make hot cakes for the kids?" 
Lennie asked. 
 
 "Yeah. That's the one. You can remember anything if there's 
anything to eat in it." George looked carefully at the solitaire


=== Question 21 ===
Why does George say Lennie will want to sleep in the barn that Friday night?

--- Chunk 1 ---
I wasn't drunk. I don't know if I was asleep. If some guy was with 
me, he could tell me I was asleep, an' then it would be all right. 
But I jus' don't know." Crooks was looking across the room now, 
looking toward the window. 
 
 Lennie said miserably, "George won't go away and leave me. I 
know George wun't do that." 
 
 The stable buck went on dreamily, "I remember when I was a 
little kid on my old man's chicken ranch. Had two brothers. They

--- Chunk 2 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 3 ---
where Lennie had been concealing it against his stomach. 
 
 Lennie sat up quickly. "Give 'um to me, George." 
 
 George said, "You get right up an' take this pup back to the nest. 
He's gotta sleep with his mother. You want to kill him? Just born 
last night an' you take him out of the nest. You take him back or 
I'll tell Slim not to let you have him." 
 
 Lennie held out his hands pleadingly. "Give 'um to me, George. 
I'll take 'um back. I didn't mean no harm, George. Honest I didn't.

--- Chunk 4 ---
Lennie giggled happily. "I didn’t forget that, you bet." 
 
 George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his 
head, and Lennie imitated him, raising his head to see whether he 
were doing it right. "God, you’re a lot of trouble," said George. "I 
could get along so easy and so nice if I didn’t have you on my tail. I 
could live so easy and maybe have a girl." 
 
 For a moment Lennie lay quiet, and then he said hopefully, "We 
gonna work on a ranch, George."

--- Chunk 5 ---
"O.K. Someday - we’re gonna get the jack together and we’re 
gonna have a little house and a couple of acres an’ a cow and some 
pigs and -" 
 
 "An’ live off the fatta the lan’,"Lennie shouted. "An’ haverabbits. 
Go on, George! Tell about what we’re gonna have in the garden 
and about the rabbits in the cages and about the rain in the 
winter and the stove, and how thick the cream is an the milk like 
you can hardly cut it. Tell about that, George."

--- Chunk 6 ---
around the end of the last stall. "Oh, Lennie!" he called again; and 
then he stopped, and his body stiffened. He rubbed his smooth 
wrist on his white stubble whiskers. "I di'n't know you was here," 
he said to Curley's wife. 
 
 When she didn't answer, he stepped nearer. "You oughten to sleep 
out here," he said disapprovingly; and then he was beside her and-
"Oh, Jesus Christ!" He looked about helplessly, and he rubbed his 
beard. And then he jumped up and went quickly out of the barn.

--- Chunk 7 ---
Maybe you wouldn’t killit. That’d be better than. mice. And you 
could pet it harder." 
 
 Lennie avoided the bait. He had sensed his advantage, "If you 
don’t want me, you only jus’ got to say so, and I’ll go off in those 
hills right there - right up in those hills and live by myself. An’ I 
won’t get no mice stole from me." 
 
 George said, "I want you to stay with me, Lennie. Jesus Christ, 
somebody’d shoot you for a coyote if you was by yourself. No, you

--- Chunk 8 ---
together and turned around to Lennie. Lennie was lying down on 
the bunk watching him. 
 
 "Look, Lennie! This here ain't no set up. I'm scared. You gonna 
have trouble with that Curley guy. I seen that kind before. He was 
kinda feelin' you out. He figures he's got you scared and he's 
gonna take a sock at you the first chance he gets." 
 
 Lennie's eyes were frightened. "I don't want no trouble," he said 
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George."

--- Chunk 9 ---
answered. 
 
  "Go on," said Lennie. 
 
 George raised the gun and his hands shook, and he dropped his 
hand to the ground again. 
 
 "Go on," said Lennie. "How's it gonna be. We gonna get a little 
place." 
 
 "We'll have a cow," said George. "An' we'll have maybe a pig an' 
chickens . . . . an' down the flat we'll have a . . . . little piece alfalfa-
" 
 
 "For the rabbits," Lennie shouted. 
 
 "For the rabbits," George repeated. 
 
 "And I get to tend the rabbits."

--- Chunk 10 ---
What was Slim doin' in the barn when you seen him?" 
 
 "Slim?" 
 
 "Sure. You seen him in the barn, an' he tol' you not to pet the 
pups so much." 
 
 "Oh, yeah. He had a can a' tar an' a paint brush. I don't know 
what for." 
 
 "You sure that girl didn't come in like she come in here today?" 
 
 "No. She never come." 
 
 George sighed. "You give me a good whore house every time," he 
said. "A guy can go in an' get drunk and get ever'thing outa his

--- Chunk 11 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

--- Chunk 12 ---
ask him." 
 
 "A brown and white one," Lennie cried excitedly. 
 
 "Come on. Le's get dinner. I don't know whether he got a brown 
and white one." 
 
 Lennie didn't move from his bunk. "You ask him right away, 
George, so he won't kill no more of em." 
 
 "Sure. Come on now, get up on your feet." 
 
 Lennie rolled off his bunk and stood up, and the two of them 
started for the door. Just as they reached it, Curley bounced in. 
 
 "You seen a girl around here?" he demanded angrily.

--- Chunk 13 ---
every damn month. Get a gallon of whisky, or set in a pool room 
and play cards or shoot pool." Lennie knelt and looked over the 
fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s face was drawn with terror. 
"An’ whatta I got," George went on furiously. "I got you! You can’t 
keep a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me shovin’ all 
over the country all the time. An’ that ain’t the,' worst. You get in 
trouble. You do bad things and I got m get you out." His voice rose

--- Chunk 14 ---
"An' when the end of the month come I could take my fifty bucks 
an' go to a . . . . cat house. . . ." He stopped again. 
 
 Lennie looked eagerly at him. "Go on, George. Ain't you gonna 
give me no more hell?" 
 
 "No," said George. 
 
 "Well, I can go away," said Lennie. "I'll go right off in the hills an' 
find a cave if you don' want me." 
 
 George shook himself again. "No," he said. "I want you to stay 
with me here." 
 
 Lennie said craftily- "Tell me like you done before."

--- Chunk 15 ---
Lennie choked with pride. "I can remember," he said. 
 
 George motioned with his spoon again. "Look, Lennie. I want you 
to look around here. You can remember this place, can’t you? The 
ranch is about a quarter mile up that way. Just follow the river?" 
 
 "Sure," said Lennie. "I can remember this. Di’n’t I remember 
about not gonna say a word?" 
 
 "’Course you did. Well, look Lennie - if you jus’ happen to get in 
trouble like you always done be fore, I want you to come right here


=== Question 22 ===
According to George, how did he end up traveling with Lennie?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Lennie giggled happily. "I didn’t forget that, you bet." 
 
 George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his 
head, and Lennie imitated him, raising his head to see whether he 
were doing it right. "God, you’re a lot of trouble," said George. "I 
could get along so easy and so nice if I didn’t have you on my tail. I

 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing

 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

indicated Lennie with his thumb. "He ain't bright. Hell of a good 
worker, though. Hell of a nice fella, but he ain't bright. I've knew 
him for a long time." 
 
 Slim looked through George and beyond him. "Ain't many guys

ever'body in the whole damn world is scared of each other."

you can almost see it." 
 
 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the 
darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," 
George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of 
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined.

--- Chunk 6 ---
tickets?" 
 
 "Oh, sure, George. I remember that now." His hands went quickly 
into his side coat pockets. He said gently, "George.... I ain’t got 
mine. I musta lost it," He looked down at the ground in despair. 
 
 "You never had none, you crazy bastard. I got both of ’em here. 
Think I’d let you carry your own work card?" 
 
 Lennie grinned with relief. "I.... I thought I put it in my side 
pocket." His hand went into the pocket again.

"An’ whatta I got," George went on furiously. "I got you! You can’t 
keep a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me shovin’ all 
over the country all the time. An’ that ain’t the,' worst. You get in 
trouble. You do bad things and I got m get you out." His voice rose

hand. He put an ace up on his scoring rack and piled a two, three 
and four of diamonds on it. "Andy's in San Quentin right now on 
account of a tart," said George. 
 
 Lennie drummed on the table with his fingers. "George?" 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "George, how long's it gonna be till we get that little place an' live 
on the fatta the lan-an' rabbits?" 
 
 "I don' know," said George. "We gotta get a big stake together. I 
know a little place we can get cheap, but they ain't givin' it away."

--- Chunk 9 ---
"He won't do it," Lennie cried. "George wouldn't do nothing like 
that. I been with George a long time. He'll come back tonight-" But 
the doubt was too much for him. "Don't you think he will?" 
 
 Crooks' face lighted with pleasure in his torture. 
 
 "Nobody can't tell what a guy'll do," he observed calmly. "Le's say 
he wants to come back and can't. S'pose he gets killed or hurt so 
he can't come back." 
 
 Lennie struggled to understand. "George won't do nothing like

--- Chunk 10 ---
Maybe you wouldn’t killit. That’d be better than. mice. And you 
could pet it harder." 
 
 Lennie avoided the bait. He had sensed his advantage, "If you 
don’t want me, you only jus’ got to say so, and I’ll go off in those 
hills right there - right up in those hills and live by myself. An’ I 
won’t get no mice stole from me." 
 
 George said, "I want you to stay with me, Lennie. Jesus Christ, 
somebody’d shoot you for a coyote if you was by yourself. No, you

--- Chunk 11 ---
Lennie choked with pride. "I can remember," he said. 
 
 George motioned with his spoon again. "Look, Lennie. I want you 
to look around here. You can remember this place, can’t you? The 
ranch is about a quarter mile up that way. Just follow the river?" 
 
 "Sure," said Lennie. "I can remember this. Di’n’t I remember 
about not gonna say a word?" 
 
 "’Course you did. Well, look Lennie - if you jus’ happen to get in 
trouble like you always done be fore, I want you to come right here

--- Chunk 12 ---
'He better not fool with Lennie if he knows what's good for 'um.' 
That's jus' what you says to me." 
 
 George turned to Lennie. "It ain't your fault," he said. "You don't 
need to be scairt no more. You done jus' what I tol' you to. Maybe 
you better go in the ' wash room an' clean up your face. You look 
like' hell." 
 
 Lennie smiled with his bruised mouth. "I didn't want no trouble," 
he said. He walked toward the door, but just before he came to it, 
he turned back. "George?"

guy. You seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?" 
 
 "Sure," said George. "I seen plenty tough little guys. But this 
Curley better not make no mistakes about Lennie. Lennie ain’t 
handy, but this Curley punk is gonna get' hurt if he messes

the mountains seemed to blaze with increasing brightness. 
 
 Lennie said softly, "I di'n't forget, you bet, God damn. Hide in the 
brush an' wait for George." He pulled his hat down low over his 
eyes. "George gonna give me hell," he said. "George gonna wish he 
was alone an' not have me botherin' him." He turned his head and 
looked at the bright mountain tops. "I can go right off there an' 
find a cave," he said. And he continued sadly, "-an' never have no

--- Chunk 15 ---

 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk


=== Question 23 ===
What happened that made George stop playing dirty tricks on Lennie?

--- Chunk 1 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 2 ---
every damn month. Get a gallon of whisky, or set in a pool room 
and play cards or shoot pool." Lennie knelt and looked over the 
fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s face was drawn with terror. 
"An’ whatta I got," George went on furiously. "I got you! You can’t

like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him

said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen.

'He better not fool with Lennie if he knows what's good for 'um.'

he turned back. "George?"

 "Sure," said George. "I seen plenty tough little guys. But this

"He won't do it," Lennie cried. "George wouldn't do nothing like 
that. I been with George a long time. He'll come back tonight-" But 
the doubt was too much for him. "Don't you think he will?" 
 
 Crooks' face lighted with pleasure in his torture. 
 
 "Nobody can't tell what a guy'll do," he observed calmly. "Le's say 
he wants to come back and can't. S'pose he gets killed or hurt so 
he can't come back." 
 
 Lennie struggled to understand. "George won't do nothing like

--- Chunk 7 ---
said. "A guy can go in an' get drunk and get ever'thing outa his 
system all at once, an' no messes. And he knows how much it's 
gonna set him back. These here jail baits is just set on the trigger 
of the hoosegow." 
 
 Lennie followed his words admiringly, and moved his lips a little 
to keep up. George continued, "You remember Andy Cushman, 
Lennie? Went to grammar school?" 
 
 "The one that his old lady used to make hot cakes for the kids?" 
Lennie asked.

--- Chunk 8 ---
"I never meant no harm, George. Honest I never." 
 
 "Well, you keep away from her, 'cause she's a rattrap if I ever 
seen one. You let Curley take the rap. He let himself in for it. 
Glove fulla vaseline," George said disgustedly. "An' I bet he's eatin' 
raw eggs and writin' to the patent medicine houses." 
 
 Lennie cried out suddenly-"I don' like this place, George. This 
ain't no good place. I wanna get outa here." 
 
 "We gotta keep it till we get a stake. We can't help it, Lennie.

--- Chunk 9 ---
into Lennie's brain. 
 
 George said quietly, "What the hell you yellin' about?" 
 
 Lennie got up on his knees. "You ain't gonna leave me, are ya, 
George? I know you ain't." 
 
 George came stiffly near and sat down beside him. 
 
 "No." 
 
 "I knowed it," Lennie cried. "You ain't that kind." 
 
 George was silent. 
 
 Lennie said, "George." 
 
 "Yeah ?" 
 
 "I done another bad thing." 
 
 "It don't make no difference," George said, and he fell silent 
again.

--- Chunk 10 ---
fastened on him. "Funny," said George. "I used to have a hell of a 
lot of fun with 'im. Used to play jokes on 'im 'cause he was too 
dumb to take care of 'imself. But he was too dumb even to know he 
had a joke played on him. I had fun. Made me seem God damn 
smart alongside of him. Why he'd do any damn thing I tol' hits. If I 
tol' him to walk over a cliff, over he'd go. That wasn't so damn 
much fun after a while. He never got mad about it, neither. I've

and four of diamonds on it. "Andy's in San Quentin right now on 
account of a tart," said George. 
 
 Lennie drummed on the table with his fingers. "George?" 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "George, how long's it gonna be till we get that little place an' live

 "I don' know," said George. "We gotta get a big stake together. I 
know a little place we can get cheap, but they ain't givin' it away."

--- Chunk 12 ---
When the sound of his footsteps had died away George turned on 
Lennie. "So you wasn’t gonna say a word. You was gonna leave 
your big flapper shut and leave me do the talkin’. Damn near lost 
us the job." 
 
 Lennie stared hopelessly at his hands. "I forgot George." 
 
 "Yeah, you forgot. You always forget, an’ I got to talk you out of 
it." He sat down heavily on. the bunk. "Now he’s got his eye on us. 
Now we got to be careful and not make no slips. You keep your big

no fun. After a long time they get mean. They get wantin' to fight 
all the time. 
 
 "Yeah, they get mean," Slim agreed. "They get so they don't want 
to talk to nobody." 
 
 "'Course Lennie's a God damn nuisance most of the time," said 
George. "But you get used to goin' around with a guy an' you can't 
get rid of him." 
 
 "He ain't mean," said Slim. "I can see Lennie ain't a bit mean." 
 
 "'Course he ain't mean. But he gets in trouble alla time because

--- Chunk 14 ---
Lennie's hands remained at his sides; he was too frightened to 
defend himself. 
 
 George was on his feet yelling, "Get him, Lennie. Don't let him do 
it." 
 
 Lennie covered his face with his huge paws and bleated with 
terror. He cried, "Make 'um stop, George." Then Curley attacked 
his stomach and cut off his wind. 
 
 Slim jumped up. "The dirty little rat," he cried, "I'll get 'um 
myself." 
 
 George put out his hand and grabbed Slim. "Wait a minute," he

--- Chunk 15 ---
Crooks bored in on him. "Want me to tell ya what'll happen? 
They'll take ya to the booby hatch. They'll tie ya up with a collar, 
like a dog." 
 
 Suddenly Lennie's eyes. centered and grew quiet, and mad. He 
stood up and walked dangerously toward Crooks. "Who hurt 
George?" he demanded. 
 
 Crooks saw the danger as it approached him. He edged back on 
his bunk to get out of the way. "I was just supposin'," he said. 
"George ain't hurt. He's all right. He'll be back all right."


=== Question 24 ===
Why did George and Lennie have to flee from Weed?

--- Chunk 1 ---
guys." He ran furiously out of the barn. Carlson said, "I'll get my 
Luger," and he ran out too. 
 
 Slim turned quietly to George. "I guess Lennie done it, all right," 
he said. "Her neck's bust. Lennie coulda did that." 
 
 George didn't answer, but he nodded slowly. His hat was so far 
down on his forehead that his eyes were covered. 
 
 Slim went on, "Maybe like that time in Weed you was tellin' 
about." 
 
 Again George nodded.

--- Chunk 2 ---
Slim went on, "Maybe like that time in Weed you was tellin' 
about." 
 
 Again George nodded. 
 
 Slim sighed. "Well, I guess we got to get him. Where you think he 
might of went?" 
 
 It seemed to take George some time to free his words. "He-would 
of went south," he said. "We come from north so he would of went 
south." 
 
 "I guess we gotta get 'im," Slim repeated. 
 
 George stepped close. "Couldn' we maybe bring him in an' they'll

 "I won’t get in no trouble, George. I ain’t gonna say a word." 
 
 "O.K. Bring your bindle over here by the fire. It’s gonna be nice 
sleepin’ here. Lookin’ up, and the leaves. Don’t build up no more 
fire. We’ll let her die down." 
 
 They made their beds on the sand, and as the blaze dropped from 
the fire the sphere of light grew smaller; the curling branches 
disappeared and only a faint glimmer showed where the tree 
trunks were. From the darkness Lennie called, "George - you

--- Chunk 4 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing

 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen.

 Lennie said softly, "I di'n't forget, you bet, God damn. Hide in the 
brush an' wait for George." He pulled his hat down low over his 
eyes. "George gonna give me hell," he said. "George gonna wish he 
was alone an' not have me botherin' him." He turned his head and

sleep in here. He'll want to sleep right out in the barn with 'em. 
We'll have trouble keepin' him from getting right in the box with 
them pups." 
 
 "It wasn't nothing," Slim repeated. "Say, you sure was right about 
him. Maybe he ain't bright, but I never seen such a worker. He 
damn near killed his partner buckin' barley. There ain't nobody 
can keep up with him. God awmighty I never seen such a strong 
guy." 
 
 George spoke proudly. "Jus' tell Lennie what to do an' he'll do it if

--- Chunk 9 ---
tried and tried." 
 
 She interrupted him. "All the time he coulda had such a good 
time if it wasn't for you. He woulda took his pay an' raised hell in 
a whore house, and he coulda set in a poolroom an' played 
snooker. But he got to take care of you." 
 
 Lennie moaned with grief. "I know, Aunt Clara, ma'am. I'll go 
right off in the hills an' I'll fin' a cave an' I'll live there so I won't 
be no more trouble to George."

--- Chunk 10 ---
"Yeah. Tha's how." George's voice was almost a whisper. He 
looked steadily at his right hand that had held the gun. 
 
 Slim twitched George's elbow. "Come on, George. Me an' you'll go 
in an' get a drink." 
 
 George let himself be helped to his feet. "Yeah, a drink." 
 
 Slim said, "You hadda, George. I swear you had-da. Come on with 
me." He led George into the entrance of the trail and up toward 
the highway. 
 
 Curley and Carlson looked after them. And Carlson said, "Now

trigger. The crash of the shot rolled up the hills and rolled down 
again. Lennie jarred, and then settled slowly forward to the sand, 
and he lay without quivering. 
 
 George shivered and looked at the gun, and then he threw it from 
him, back up on the bank, near the pile of old ashes. 
 
 The brush seemed filled with cries and with the sound of running 
feet. Slim's voice shouted, "George. Where you at, George?" 
 
 But George sat stify on the bank and looked at his right hand

--- Chunk 12 ---
George was quiet for a moment. "But not us," he said. 
 
   
 
 "Because-" 
 
 "Because I got you an'' 
 
 "An' I got you. We got each other, that's what, that gives a hoot in 
hell about us," Lennie cried in triumph. 
 
 The little evening breeze blew over the clearing and the leaves 
rustled and the wind waves flowed up the green pool. And the 
shouts of men sounded again, this time much closer than before. 
 
 George took off his hat. He said shakily, "Take off your hat,

--- Chunk 13 ---
George stepped close. "Couldn' we maybe bring him in an' they'll 
lock him up? He's nuts, Slim. He never done this to be mean." 
 
 Slim nodded. "We might," he said. "If we could keep Curley in, we 
might. But Curley's gonna want to shoot 'im. Curley's still mad 
about his hand. An' s'pose they lock him up an' strap him down 
and put him in a cage. That ain't no good, George." 
 
 "I know," said George. "I know."

--- Chunk 14 ---
But Candy said excitedly, "We oughtta let'im get away. You don't 
know that Curley. Curley gon'ta wanta get 'im lynched. Curley'll 
get 'im killed." 
 
 George watched Candy's lips. "Yeah," he said at last, "that's right, 
Curley will. An' the other guys will." And he looked back at 
Curley's wife. 
 
 Now Candy spoke his greatest fear. "You an' me can get that little 
place, can't we, George? You an' me can go there an' live nice, can't 
we, George? Can't we?"

--- Chunk 15 ---
But George sat stify on the bank and looked at his right hand 
that had thrown the gun away. The group burst into the clearing, 
and Curley was ahead. He saw Lennie lying on the sand. "Got 
him, by God." He went over and looked down at Lennie, and then 
he looked back at George. "Right in the back of the head," he said 
softly.


=== Question 25 ===
Who makes the final decision on whether or not Candy's old dog should be shot?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Carlson finished the cleaning of the gun and put it in the bag and 
pushed the bag under his bunk. "I guess I'll go out and look her 
over," he said. Old Candy lay still, and Lennie, from his bunk, 
watched George cautiously. 
 
 When Whit and Carlson were gone and the door closed after 
them, George turned to Lennie. "What you got on your mind?" 
 
 "I ain't done nothing, George. Slim says I better not pet them 
pups so much for a while. Slim says it ain't good for them; so I

--- Chunk 2 ---
That dog of Candy's is so God damn old he can't hardly walk. 
Stinks like hell, too. Ever' time he comes into the bunk house I can 
smell him for two, three days. Why'n't you get Candy to shoot his 
old dog and give him one of the pups to raise up? I can smell that 
dog a mile away. Got no teeth, damn near blind, can't eat. Candy 
feeds him milk. He can't chew nothing else." 
 
 George had been staring intently at Slim. Suddenly a triangle

--- Chunk 3 ---
"Don't tell nobody," Lennie said to himself. 
 
 Candy said, "George." 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "I ought to of shot that dog myself, George. I shouldn't ought to of 
let no stranger shoot my dog." 
 
 The door opened. Slim came in, followed by Curley and Carlson 
and Whit. Slim's hands were black with tar and he was scowling. 
Curley hung close to his elbow. 
 
 Curley said, "Well, I didn't mean nothing, Slim. I just ast you." 
 
 Slim said, "Well, you been askin' me too often. I'm gettin' God

--- Chunk 4 ---
Candy looked about unhappily. "No," he said softly. "No, I 
couldn't do that. I had 'im too long." 
 
 "He don't have no fun," Carlson insisted. "And he stinks to beat 
hell. Tell you what. I'll shoot him for you. Then it won't be you 
that does it." 
 
 Candy threw his legs off his bunk. He scratched the white stubble 
whiskers on his check nervously. 
 
   
 
 "I'm so used to him," he said softly. "I had him from a pup."

--- Chunk 5 ---
"He's plenty good," said Slim. 
 
 "Damn right he is," said Carlson. "He don't give nobody else a 
chance to win-" He stopped and sniffed the air, and still sniffing, 
looked down at the old dog. "God awmighty, that dog stinks. Get 
him outa here, Candy! I don't know nothing that stinks as bad as 
an old dog. You gotta get him out." 
 
 Candy rolled to the edge of his bunk. He reached over and patted 
the ancient dog, and he apologized, "I been around him so much I

at the ceiling. 
 
 From his pocket Carlson took a little leather thong. He stooped 
over and tied it around the old dog's neck. All the men except 
Candy watched him. 
 
 "Come boy. Come on, boy," he said gently. And he said 
apologetically to Candy, "He won't even feel it." Candy did not 
move nor answer him. He twitched the thong. "Come on, boy." The 
old dog got slowly and stiffly to his feet and followed the gently 
pulling leash. 
 
 Slim said, "Carlson." 
 
 "Yeah?"

--- Chunk 7 ---
the ancient dog, and he apologized, "I been around him so much I 
never notice how he stinks." 
 
 "Well, I can't stand him in here," said Carlson. "That stink hangs 
around even after he's gone." He walked over with his heavy-
legged stride and looked down at the dog. "Got no teeth," he said. 
"He's all stiff with rheumatism. He ain't no good to you, Candy. 
An' he ain't no good to himself. Why'n't you shoot him, Candy?" 
 
 The old man squirmed uncomfortably. "Well-hell! I had him so

--- Chunk 8 ---
we'll shoot 'im. " 
 
 George said weakly, "Maybe Carlson lost his gun.,, 
 
 "I seen it this morning," said Carlson. "No, it's been took." 
 
 Slim stood looking down at Curley's wife. He said, "Curley-maybe 
you better stay here with your wife." 
 
 Curley's face reddened. "I'm goin'," he said. "I'm gonna shoot the 
guts outa that big bastard myself, even if I only got one hand. I'm 
gonna get 'im." 
 
 Slim turned to Candy. "You stay here with her then, Candy. The

--- Chunk 9 ---
"I'm so used to him," he said softly. "I had him from a pup." 
 
 "Well, you ain't bein' kind to him keepin' him alive," said Carlson. 
"Look, Slim's bitch got a litter right now. I bet Slim would give you 
one of them pnps to raise up, wouldn't you, Slim?" 
 
 The skinner had been studying the old dog with his calm eyes. 
"Yeah," he said. "You can have a pup if you want to." He seemed to 
shake himself free for speech. "Carl's right, Candy. That dog ain't

--- Chunk 10 ---
But Candy said excitedly, "We oughtta let'im get away. You don't 
know that Curley. Curley gon'ta wanta get 'im lynched. Curley'll 
get 'im killed." 
 
 George watched Candy's lips. "Yeah," he said at last, "that's right, 
Curley will. An' the other guys will." And he looked back at 
Curley's wife. 
 
 Now Candy spoke his greatest fear. "You an' me can get that little 
place, can't we, George? You an' me can go there an' live nice, can't 
we, George? Can't we?"

--- Chunk 11 ---
outside. He crouched down in the hay and listened. "I done a real 
bad thing," he said. "I shouldn't of did that. George'll be mad. An' . 
. . . he said . . . . an' hide in the brush till he come. He's gonna be 
mad. In the brush till he come. Tha's what he said." Lennie went-
back and looked at the dead girl. The puppy lay close to her. 
Lennie picked it up. "I'll throw him away," he said. "It's bad 
enough like it is." He put the pup under his coat, and he crept to

--- Chunk 12 ---
"The hell I ain't. Got a Luger. It won't hurt him none at all." 
 
 Candy said, "Maybe tomorra. Le's wait till tomorra." 
 
 "I don't see no reason for it," said Carlson. He went to his bunk, 
pulled his bag from underneath it and took out a Luger pistol. 
"Le's get it over with," he said. "We can't sleep with him stinkin' 
around in here." He put the pistol in his hip pocket. 
 
 Candy looked a long time at Slim to try to find some reversal. And

--- Chunk 13 ---
Lennie said, "Well, I ain't supposed to. George's scared I'll get in 
trouble." 
 
 She changed the subject. "What you got covered up there?" 
 
 Then all of Lennie's woe came back on him. "Joe my pup," he said 
sadly. "Jus' my little pup." And he swept the hay from on top of it. 
 
 "Why, he's dead," she cried. 
 
 "He was so little," said Lennie. "I was jus' playin' with him . . . . 
an' he made like he's gonna bite me . . . . an' I made like I was

--- Chunk 14 ---
where Lennie had been concealing it against his stomach. 
 
 Lennie sat up quickly. "Give 'um to me, George." 
 
 George said, "You get right up an' take this pup back to the nest. 
He's gotta sleep with his mother. You want to kill him? Just born 
last night an' you take him out of the nest. You take him back or 
I'll tell Slim not to let you have him." 
 
 Lennie held out his hands pleadingly. "Give 'um to me, George. 
I'll take 'um back. I didn't mean no harm, George. Honest I didn't.

--- Chunk 15 ---
"Sure he's jes' like a kid. There ain't no more harm in him than a 
kid neither, except he's so strong. I bet he won't come in here to 
sleep tonight. He'd sleep right alongside that box in the barn. 
Well-let 'im. He ain't doin' no harm out there." 
 
 It was almost dark outside now. Old Candy, the swamper, came 
in and went to his bunk, and behind him struggled his old dog. 
"Hello, Slim. Hello, George. Didn't neither of you play 
horseshoes?"

Why does George agree to let Candy come with them to their dream farm?

--- Chunk 1 ---
place, can't we, George? You an' me can go there an' live nice, can't 
we, George? Can't we?" 
 
 Before George answered, Candy dropped his head and looked 
down at the hay. He knew. 
 
 George said softly, "-I think I knowed from the very first I think I 
knowed we'd never do her. He usta like to hear about it so much I 
got to thinking maybe we would." 
 
 "Then-it's all off?" Candy said sulkily. 
 
 George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my

--- Chunk 2 ---
Candy cried, "Sure they all want it. Everybody wants a little bit of 
land, not much. Jus' som'thin' that was his. Som'thin' he could live 
on and there couldn't nobody throw him off of it. I never had none. 
I planted crops for damn near ever'body in this state, but they 
wasn't my crops, and when I harvested 'em, it wasn't none of any 
harvest. But we gonna do it now, and don't you make no mistake 
about that. George ain't got the money in town. That money's in

--- Chunk 3 ---
"I guess maybe way back in my head I did." 
 
 Candy asked, "What we gonna do now, George? What we gonna 
do now?" 
 
 George was a long time in answering. "Guess . . . . we gotta tell 
the . . . . guys. I guess we gotta get 'im an' lock 'im up. We can't let 
'im get away. Why, the poor bastard'd starve." And he tried to 
reassure himself. "Maybe they'll lock 'im up an' be nice to In."

--- Chunk 4 ---
But Candy said excitedly, "We oughtta let'im get away. You don't 
know that Curley. Curley gon'ta wanta get 'im lynched. Curley'll 
get 'im killed." 
 
 George watched Candy's lips. "Yeah," he said at last, "that's right, 
Curley will. An' the other guys will." And he looked back at 
Curley's wife. 
 
 Now Candy spoke his greatest fear. "You an' me can get that little 
place, can't we, George? You an' me can go there an' live nice, can't 
we, George? Can't we?"

--- Chunk 5 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 6 ---
know a little place we can get cheap, but they ain't givin' it away." 
 
 Old Candy turned slowly over. His eyes were wide open. He 
watched George carefully. 
 
 Lennie said, "Tell about that place, George." 
 
 "I jus' tol' you, jus' las' night." 
 
 "Go on-tell again, George." 
 
 "Well, it's ten acres," said George. "Got a little win'mill. Got a 
little shack on it, an' a chicken run. Got a kitchen, orchard, 
cherries, apples, peaches, 'cots, nuts, got a few berries. They's a

--- Chunk 7 ---
in with you guys. Tha's three hunderd an' fifty bucks I'd put in. I 
ain't much good, but I could cook and tend the chickens and hoe 
the garden some. How'd that be?" 
 
 George half-closed his eyes. "I gotta think about that. We was 
always gonna do it by ourselves." 
 
 Candy interrupted him, "I'd make a will an' leave my share to you 
guys in case I kick off, 'cause I ain't got no relatives nor nothing. 
You guys got any money? Maybe we could do her right now?"

--- Chunk 8 ---
and I'll come along and make like I never seen her. Will you do 
that? So the guys won't think I was in on it?" 
 
 Candy said, "Sure, George. Sure I'll do that." 
 
 "O.K. Give me a couple minutes then, and you come runnin' out 
an' tell like you jus' found her. I'm going now." George turned and 
went quickly out of the barn. 
 
 Old Candy watched him go. He looked helplessly back at Curley's 
wife, and gradually his sorrow and his anger grew into words.

--- Chunk 9 ---
cow or a goat, and the cream is so God damn thick you got to cut it 
with a knife and take it out with a spoon." 
 
 Lennie watched him with wide eyes, and old Candy watched him 
too. Lennie said softly, "We could live offa the fatta the lan'." 
 
 "Sure," said George. "All kin's a vegetables in the garden, and if 
we want a little whisky we can sell a few eggs or something, or 
some milk. We'd jus' live there. We'd belong there. There wouldn't

--- Chunk 10 ---
res', an' you could sell eggs an' stuff like that." 
 
 They fell into a silence. They looked at one another, amazed. This 
thing they had never really believed in was coming true. George 
said reverently, "Jesus Christ! I bet we could swing her." His eyes 
were full of wonder. "I bet we could swing her," he repeated softly. 
 
 Candy sat on the edge of his bunk. He scratched the stump of his 
wrist nervously. "I got hurt four year ago," he said. "They'll can me

--- Chunk 11 ---
matter with her?" he asked. He stepped closer, and then he echoed 
Candy's words. "Oh, Jesus Christ!" He was down on his knees 
beside her.He put his hand over her heart. And finally, when he 
stood up, slowly and stify, his face was as hard and tight as wood, 
and his eyes were hard. 
 
 Candy said, "What done it?" 
 
 George looked coldly at him. "Ain't you got any idear?" he asked. 
And Candy was silent. "I should of knew," George said hopelessly. 
"I guess maybe way back in my head I did."

--- Chunk 12 ---
"For the rabbits," George repeated. 
 
 "And I get to tend the rabbits." 
 
 "An' you get to tend the rabbits." 
 
 Lennie giggled with happiness. "An' live on the fatta the lan'." 
 
 "Yes." 
 
 Lennie turned his head. 
 
 "No, Lennie. Look down there acrost the river, like you can 
almost see the place." 
 
 Lennie obeyed him. George looked down at the gun. 
 
 There were crashing footsteps in the brush now. George turned 
and looked toward them. 
 
 "Go on, George. When we gonna do it?"

--- Chunk 13 ---
"Sure will," said Candy. "They got a good stove there?" 
 
 "Sure, got a nice stove, burns coal or wood." 
 
 "I'm gonna take my pup," said Lennie. "I bet by Christ he likes it 
there, by Jesus." 
 
 Voices were approaching from outside. George said quickly, 
"Don't tell nobody about it. Jus' us three an' nobody else. They 
li'ble to can us so we can't make no stake. Jus' go on like we was 
gonna buck barley the rest of our lives, then all of a sudden some

--- Chunk 14 ---
answered. 
 
  "Go on," said Lennie. 
 
 George raised the gun and his hands shook, and he dropped his 
hand to the ground again. 
 
 "Go on," said Lennie. "How's it gonna be. We gonna get a little 
place." 
 
 "We'll have a cow," said George. "An' we'll have maybe a pig an' 
chickens . . . . an' down the flat we'll have a . . . . little piece alfalfa-
" 
 
 "For the rabbits," Lennie shouted. 
 
 "For the rabbits," George repeated. 
 
 "And I get to tend the rabbits."

--- Chunk 15 ---
'em. He promised." 
 
 Crooks interrupted brutally. "You guys is just kiddin' yourself. 
You'll talk about it a hell of a lot, but you won't get no land. You'll 
be a swamper here till they take you out in a box. Hell, I seen too 
many guys. Lennie here'll quit an' be on the road in two, three 
weeks. Seems like ever' guy got land in his head." 
 
 Candy rubbed his cheek angrily. "You God damn right we're 
gonna do it. George says we are. We got the money right now."


=== Question 28 ===
Why does Curley attack Lennie in the bunk house?

--- Chunk 1 ---
together and turned around to Lennie. Lennie was lying down on 
the bunk watching him. 
 
 "Look, Lennie! This here ain't no set up. I'm scared. You gonna 
have trouble with that Curley guy. I seen that kind before. He was 
kinda feelin' you out. He figures he's got you scared and he's 
gonna take a sock at you the first chance he gets." 
 
 Lennie's eyes were frightened. "I don't want no trouble," he said 
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George."

--- Chunk 2 ---
ask him." 
 
 "A brown and white one," Lennie cried excitedly. 
 
 "Come on. Le's get dinner. I don't know whether he got a brown 
and white one." 
 
 Lennie didn't move from his bunk. "You ask him right away, 
George, so he won't kill no more of em." 
 
 "Sure. Come on now, get up on your feet." 
 
 Lennie rolled off his bunk and stood up, and the two of them 
started for the door. Just as they reached it, Curley bounced in. 
 
 "You seen a girl around here?" he demanded angrily.

--- Chunk 3 ---
bunk house, and she hurried away. 
 
 George looked around at Lennie. "Jesus, what a tramp," he said. 
"So that's what Curley picks for a wife." 
 
 "She's purty," said Lennie defensively. 
 
 "Yeah, and she's sure hidin' it. Curley got his work ahead of him. 
Bet she'd clear out for twenty bucks." 
 
 Lennie still stared at the doorway where she had been. "Gosh, she 
was purty." He smiled admiringly. George looked quickly down at 
him and then he took him by an ear and shook him.

--- Chunk 4 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

--- Chunk 5 ---
looked sullenly up at her.She said, "What you got there, sonny 
boy?" 
 
 Lennie glared at her. "George says I ain't to have nothing to do 
with you-talk to you or nothing." 
 
 She laughed "George giving you orders about everything?" 
 
 Lennie looked down at the hay. "Says I can't tend no rabbits if I 
talk to you or anything." 
 
 She said quietly, "He's scared Curley'll get mad. Well, Curley got 
his arm in a sling-an' if Curley gets tough, you can break his other

--- Chunk 6 ---
he said quietly. "If you go right now, we won't tell Curley you was 
here." 
 
 She appraised him coolly. "I ain't sure you heard nothing." 
 
 "Better not take no chances," he said. "If you ain't sure, you better 
take the safe way." 
 
 She turned to Lennie. "I'm glad you bust up Curley a little bit. He 
got it comin' to him. Sometimes I'd like to bust him myself." She 
slipped out the door and disappeared into the dark barn. And

--- Chunk 7 ---
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George." 
 
 George got up and went over to Lennie's bunk and sat down on it. 
"I hate that kinda bastard," he said. "I seen plenty of 'em. Like the 
old guy says, Curley don't take no chances. He always wins." He 
thought for a moment. "If he tangles with you, Lennie, we're 
gonna get the can. Don't make no mistake about that. He's the 
boss's son. Look, Lennie. You try to keep away from him, will you?

--- Chunk 8 ---
lighted on Lennie; and Lennie was still smiling with delight at the 
memory of the ranch. 
 
 Curley stepped over to Lennie like a terrier. "What the hell you 
laughin' at?" 
 
 Lennie looked blankly at him. "Huh?" 
 
 Then Curley's rage exploded. "Come on, ya big bastard. Get up on 
your feet. No big son-of-a-bitch is gonna laugh at me. I'll show ya 
who's yella." 
 
 Lennie looked helplessly at George, and then he got up and tried

--- Chunk 9 ---
with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at ’em because he ain’t a big 
guy. You seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?" 
 
 "Sure," said George. "I seen plenty tough little guys. But this 
Curley better not make no mistakes about Lennie. Lennie ain’t 
handy, but this Curley punk is gonna get' hurt if he messes

--- Chunk 10 ---
around the end of the last stall. "Oh, Lennie!" he called again; and 
then he stopped, and his body stiffened. He rubbed his smooth 
wrist on his white stubble whiskers. "I di'n't know you was here," 
he said to Curley's wife. 
 
 When she didn't answer, he stepped nearer. "You oughten to sleep 
out here," he said disapprovingly; and then he was beside her and-
"Oh, Jesus Christ!" He looked about helplessly, and he rubbed his 
beard. And then he jumped up and went quickly out of the barn.

--- Chunk 11 ---
Slim says I ain't to pet 'em very much." 
 
 Crooks said, "Well, you been takin' 'em out of the nest all the 
time. I wonder the old lady don't move 'em someplace else." 
 
 "Oh, she don't care. She lets me." Lennie had moved into the room 
again. 
 
 Crooks scowled, but Lennie's disarming smile defeated him. 
"Come on in and set a while," Crooks said. "'Long as you won't get 
out and leave me alone, you might as well set down." His tone was

--- Chunk 12 ---
Crooks bored in on him. "Want me to tell ya what'll happen? 
They'll take ya to the booby hatch. They'll tie ya up with a collar, 
like a dog." 
 
 Suddenly Lennie's eyes. centered and grew quiet, and mad. He 
stood up and walked dangerously toward Crooks. "Who hurt 
George?" he demanded. 
 
 Crooks saw the danger as it approached him. He edged back on 
his bunk to get out of the way. "I was just supposin'," he said. 
"George ain't hurt. He's all right. He'll be back all right."

--- Chunk 13 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 14 ---
pretty handy. He done quite a bit in the ring. He’s a lightweight, 
and he’s handy." 
 
 "Well, let him be handy," said George, "He don’t have to take after 
Lennie. Lennie didn’t do nothing to him. What’s he got against 
Lennie?" 
 
 The swamper considered..... "Well.... tell you what. Curley’s like a

 Curley sat down on the floor, looking in wonder at his crushed 
hand. Slim and Carlson bent over him. Then Slim straightened up 
and regarded Lennie with horror. "We got to get him in to a 
doctor," he said. "Looks to me like ever' bone in his han' is bust." 
 
 "I didn't wanta," Lennie cried. "I didn't wanta hurt him." 
 
 Slim said, "Carlson, you get the candy wagon hitched up. We'll

 "Well, you keep away from her, 'cause she's a rattrap if I ever

Glove fulla vaseline," George said disgustedly. "An' I bet he's eatin'

 Lennie cried out suddenly-"I don' like this place, George. This 
ain't no good place. I wanna get outa here." 
 
 "We gotta keep it till we get a stake. We can't help it, Lennie.

up on the big guy. Never did seem right to me. Seems like Curley 
ain’t givin’ nobody a chance." 
 
 George was watching the door. He said ominously, "Well, he 
better watch out for Lennie. Lennie ain’t no fighter, but Lennie’s 
strong and quick, and Lennie don’t know no rules." He walked to 
the square table and sat down on one of the boxes. He gathered 
some of the cards together and shuffled them. 
 
 The old man sat down on another box. "Don’t tell Curley I said

--- Chunk 9 ---
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George." 
 
 George got up and went over to Lennie's bunk and sat down on it. 
"I hate that kinda bastard," he said. "I seen plenty of 'em. Like the

thought for a moment. "If he tangles with you, Lennie, we're

 Lennie's eyes were frightened. "I don't want no trouble," he said 
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George."

--- Chunk 11 ---
Curley's wife moved away from him a little. "I think you're nuts," 
she said. 
 
 "No I ain't," Lennie explained earnestly. "George says I ain't. I 
like to pet nice things with my fingers, sof' things. " 
 
 She was a little bit reassured. "Well, who don't?" she said. 
"Ever'body likes that. I like to feel silk an' velvet. Do you like to 
feel velvet?" 
 
 Lennie chuckled with pleasure. "You bet, by God," he cried 
happily. "An' I had some, too. A lady give me some, an' that lady

--- Chunk 12 ---
every damn month. Get a gallon of whisky, or set in a pool room 
and play cards or shoot pool." Lennie knelt and looked over the 
fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s face was drawn with terror. 
"An’ whatta I got," George went on furiously. "I got you! You can’t 
keep a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me shovin’ all 
over the country all the time. An’ that ain’t the,' worst. You get in 
trouble. You do bad things and I got m get you out." His voice rose

--- Chunk 13 ---
George stepped close. "Couldn' we maybe bring him in an' they'll 
lock him up? He's nuts, Slim. He never done this to be mean." 
 
 Slim nodded. "We might," he said. "If we could keep Curley in, we 
might. But Curley's gonna want to shoot 'im. Curley's still mad 
about his hand. An' s'pose they lock him up an' strap him down 
and put him in a cage. That ain't no good, George." 
 
 "I know," said George. "I know."

--- Chunk 14 ---
stiffened and a scowl came on his face. His hand came out from 
under his shirt. 
 
 Lennie smiled helplessly in an attempt to make friends.

--- Chunk 15 ---
Lennie's hands remained at his sides; he was too frightened to 
defend himself. 
 
 George was on his feet yelling, "Get him, Lennie. Don't let him do 
it." 
 
 Lennie covered his face with his huge paws and bleated with 
terror. He cried, "Make 'um stop, George." Then Curley attacked 
his stomach and cut off his wind. 
 
 Slim jumped up. "The dirty little rat," he cried, "I'll get 'um 
myself." 
 
 George put out his hand and grabbed Slim. "Wait a minute," he

 Lennie glared at her. "George says I ain't to have nothing to do 
with you-talk to you or nothing." 
 
 She laughed "George giving you orders about everything?" 
 
 Lennie looked down at the hay. "Says I can't tend no rabbits if I 
talk to you or anything." 
 
 She said quietly, "He's scared Curley'll get mad. Well, Curley got 
his arm in a sling-an' if Curley gets tough, you can break his other

pretty handy. He done quite a bit in the ring. He’s a lightweight, 
and he’s handy." 
 
 "Well, let him be handy," said George, "He don’t have to take after 
Lennie. Lennie didn’t do nothing to him. What’s he got against 
Lennie?" 
 
 The swamper considered..... "Well.... tell you what. Curley’s like a 
lot of little guys. He hates big guys. He’s alla time picking scraps 
with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at ’em because he ain’t a big

plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George." 
 
 George got up and went over to Lennie's bunk and sat down on it. 
"I hate that kinda bastard," he said. "I seen plenty of 'em. Like the 
old guy says, Curley don't take no chances. He always wins." He 
thought for a moment. "If he tangles with you, Lennie, we're 
gonna get the can. Don't make no mistake about that. He's the 
boss's son. Look, Lennie. You try to keep away from him, will you?

wall. "You tol' me to, George," he said miserably. 
 
 Curley sat down on the floor, looking in wonder at his crushed 
hand. Slim and Carlson bent over him. Then Slim straightened up 
and regarded Lennie with horror. "We got to get him in to a 
doctor," he said. "Looks to me like ever' bone in his han' is bust." 
 
 "I didn't wanta," Lennie cried. "I didn't wanta hurt him." 
 
 Slim said, "Carlson, you get the candy wagon hitched up. We'll

 "Well, you keep away from her, 'cause she's a rattrap if I ever

Glove fulla vaseline," George said disgustedly. "An' I bet he's eatin' 
raw eggs and writin' to the patent medicine houses." 
 
 Lennie cried out suddenly-"I don' like this place, George. This 
ain't no good place. I wanna get outa here." 
 
 "We gotta keep it till we get a stake. We can't help it, Lennie.

--- Chunk 9 ---
George stepped close. "Couldn' we maybe bring him in an' they'll 
lock him up? He's nuts, Slim. He never done this to be mean." 
 
 Slim nodded. "We might," he said. "If we could keep Curley in, we 
might. But Curley's gonna want to shoot 'im. Curley's still mad 
about his hand. An' s'pose they lock him up an' strap him down 
and put him in a cage. That ain't no good, George." 
 
 "I know," said George. "I know."

--- Chunk 10 ---
he said quietly. "If you go right now, we won't tell Curley you was 
here." 
 
 She appraised him coolly. "I ain't sure you heard nothing." 
 
 "Better not take no chances," he said. "If you ain't sure, you better 
take the safe way." 
 
 She turned to Lennie. "I'm glad you bust up Curley a little bit. He 
got it comin' to him. Sometimes I'd like to bust him myself." She 
slipped out the door and disappeared into the dark barn. And

--- Chunk 11 ---
"He won't do it," Lennie cried. "George wouldn't do nothing like 
that. I been with George a long time. He'll come back tonight-" But 
the doubt was too much for him. "Don't you think he will?" 
 
 Crooks' face lighted with pleasure in his torture. 
 
 "Nobody can't tell what a guy'll do," he observed calmly. "Le's say 
he wants to come back and can't. S'pose he gets killed or hurt so 
he can't come back." 
 
 Lennie struggled to understand. "George won't do nothing like

--- Chunk 12 ---
But Candy said excitedly, "We oughtta let'im get away. You don't 
know that Curley. Curley gon'ta wanta get 'im lynched. Curley'll 
get 'im killed." 
 
 George watched Candy's lips. "Yeah," he said at last, "that's right, 
Curley will. An' the other guys will." And he looked back at 
Curley's wife. 
 
 Now Candy spoke his greatest fear. "You an' me can get that little 
place, can't we, George? You an' me can go there an' live nice, can't 
we, George? Can't we?"

--- Chunk 13 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 14 ---
Curley came suddenly to life. "I know who done it," he cried. 
"That big son-of-a-bitch done it. I know he done it. Why-ever'body 
else was out there playin' horseshoes." He worked himself into a 
fury. "I'm gonna get him. I'm going for my shotgun. I'll kill the big 
son-of-a-bitch myself. I'll shoot 'im in the guts. Come on, you 
guys." He ran furiously out of the barn. Carlson said, "I'll get my 
Luger," and he ran out too.

terror. He shook her then, and he was angry with her. "Don't you 
go yellin'," he said, and he shook her; and her body flopped like a 
fish. And then she was still, for Lennie had broken her neck. 
 
 He looked down at her, and carefully be removed his hand from 
over her mouth, and she lay still. "I don't want to hurt you," he 
said, "but George'll be mad if you yell." When she didn't answer 
nor move he bent closely over her. He lifted her arm and let it


=== Question 31 ===
Why has Crooks been able to accumulate more personal items than the other ranch hands?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Curley said, "You go in Soledad an' get a cop. Get AI Wilts, he's 
deputy sheriff. Le's go now." He turned suspiciously on George. 
"You're comin' with us, fella." 
 
 "Yeah," said George. "I'll come. But listen, Curley. The poor 
bastard's nuts. Don't shoot 'im. He di'n't know what he was doin'." 
 
 "Don't shoot 'im?" Curley cried. "He got Carlson's Luger. 'Course 
we'll shoot 'im. " 
 
 George said weakly, "Maybe Carlson lost his gun.,,

answered. 
 
  "Go on," said Lennie. 
 
 George raised the gun and his hands shook, and he dropped his 
hand to the ground again. 
 
 "Go on," said Lennie. "How's it gonna be. We gonna get a little 
place." 
 
 "We'll have a cow," said George. "An' we'll have maybe a pig an' 
chickens . . . . an' down the flat we'll have a . . . . little piece alfalfa-

 "For the rabbits," Lennie shouted. 
 
 "For the rabbits," George repeated. 
 
 "And I get to tend the rabbits."

guys." He ran furiously out of the barn. Carlson said, "I'll get my 
Luger," and he ran out too. 
 
 Slim turned quietly to George. "I guess Lennie done it, all right," 
he said. "Her neck's bust. Lennie coulda did that." 
 
 George didn't answer, but he nodded slowly. His hat was so far 
down on his forehead that his eyes were covered. 
 
 Slim went on, "Maybe like that time in Weed you was tellin' 
about." 
 
 Again George nodded.

--- Chunk 4 ---
barn, and he rubbed his bristly whiskers with his wrist stump. 
 
 Outside the noise of the game stopped. There was a rise of voices 
in question, a drum of running feet and the men burst into the 
barn. Slim and Carlson and young Whit and Curley, and Crooks 
keeping back out of attention range. Candy came after them, and 
last of all came George. George had put on his blue denim coat and 
buttoned it, and his black hat was pulled down low over his eyes.

--- Chunk 5 ---
"Yeah. Tha's how." George's voice was almost a whisper. He 
looked steadily at his right hand that had held the gun. 
 
 Slim twitched George's elbow. "Come on, George. Me an' you'll go 
in an' get a drink." 
 
 George let himself be helped to his feet. "Yeah, a drink." 
 
 Slim said, "You hadda, George. I swear you had-da. Come on with 
me." He led George into the entrance of the trail and up toward 
the highway. 
 
 Curley and Carlson looked after them. And Carlson said, "Now

--- Chunk 6 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 7 ---
Slim came directly to George and sat down beside him, sat very 
close to him. "Never you mind," said Slim. "A guy got to 
sometimes." 
 
 But Carlson was standing over George. "How'd you do it?" he 
asked. 
 
 "I just done it," George said tiredly. 
 
 "Did he have my gun?" 
 
 "Yeah. He had your gun." 
 
 "An' you got it away from him and you took it an' you killed him?" 
 
 "Yeah. Tha's how." George's voice was almost a whisper. He

--- Chunk 8 ---
was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so 
you can almost see it." 
 
 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the 
darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," 
George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of 
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined.

--- Chunk 9 ---
Carlson came running in, "The bastard's stole my Luger," he 
shouted. "It ain't in my bag." Curley followed him, and Curley 
carried a shotgun in his good hand. Curley was cold now. 
 
 "All right, you guys," he said. "The nigger's got a shotgun. You 
take it, Carlson. When you see 'urn, don't give 'im no chance. 
Shoot for his guts. That'll double 'im over." 
 
 Whit said excitedly, "I ain't got a gun." 
 
 Curley said, "You go in Soledad an' get a cop. Get AI Wilts, he's

--- Chunk 10 ---
Curley came suddenly to life. "I know who done it," he cried. 
"That big son-of-a-bitch done it. I know he done it. Why-ever'body 
else was out there playin' horseshoes." He worked himself into a 
fury. "I'm gonna get him. I'm going for my shotgun. I'll kill the big

nor move he bent closely over her. He lifted her arm and let it 
drop. For a moment he seemed bewildered. And then he whispered 
in fright, "I done a bad thing. I done another bad thing." 
 
 He pawed up the hay until it partly covered her. 
 
 From outside the barn came a cry of men and the double clang of 
shoes on metal. For the first time Lennie became conscious of the 
outside. He crouched down in the hay and listened. "I done a real

--- Chunk 12 ---
George moved slowly after them, and his feet dragged heavily. 
 
 And when they were gone, Candy squatted down in the hay and 
watched the face of Curley's wife. "Poor bastard," he said softly. 
 
 The sound of the men grew fainter. The barn was darkening 
gradually and, in their stalls, the horses shifted their feet and 
rattled the halter chains. Old Candy lay down in the hay and 
covered his eyes with his arm. 
 
   
 
   
 
   
 
   
 CHAPTER  6

--- Chunk 13 ---
But George sat stify on the bank and looked at his right hand 
that had thrown the gun away. The group burst into the clearing, 
and Curley was ahead. He saw Lennie lying on the sand. "Got 
him, by God." He went over and looked down at Lennie, and then 
he looked back at George. "Right in the back of the head," he said 
softly.

--- Chunk 14 ---
"For the rabbits," George repeated. 
 
 "And I get to tend the rabbits." 
 
 "An' you get to tend the rabbits." 
 
 Lennie giggled with happiness. "An' live on the fatta the lan'." 
 
 "Yes." 
 
 Lennie turned his head. 
 
 "No, Lennie. Look down there acrost the river, like you can 
almost see the place." 
 
 Lennie obeyed him. George looked down at the gun. 
 
 There were crashing footsteps in the brush now. George turned 
and looked toward them. 
 
 "Go on, George. When we gonna do it?"

--- Chunk 15 ---
we'll shoot 'im. " 
 
 George said weakly, "Maybe Carlson lost his gun.,, 
 
 "I seen it this morning," said Carlson. "No, it's been took." 
 
 Slim stood looking down at Curley's wife. He said, "Curley-maybe 
you better stay here with your wife." 
 
 Curley's face reddened. "I'm goin'," he said. "I'm gonna shoot the 
guts outa that big bastard myself, even if I only got one hand. I'm 
gonna get 'im." 
 
 Slim turned to Candy. "You stay here with her then, Candy. The


=== Question 32 ===
What reason does Crooks first give for Lennie not being welcome in his room?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Crooks said sharply, "You got no right to come in my room. This 
here's my room. Nobody got any right in here but me." 
 
 Lennie gulped and his smile grew more fawning. "I ain't doing 
nothing," he said. "Just come to look at my puppy. And I seen your 
light," he explained. 
 
 "Well, I got a right to have a light. You go on get outta my room. I 
ain't wanted in the bunk house, and you ain't wanted in my room." 
 
 "Why ain't you wanted?" Lennie asked.

--- Chunk 2 ---
"It's George," Lennie cried. And he answered, "Here, George. I'm 
right in here." 
 
 In a second George stood framed in the door, and he looked 
disapprovingly about. "What you doin' in Crooks' room? You 
hadn't ought to lie here." 
 
 Crooks nodded "I tol' 'em, but they come in anyways." 
 
 "Well, why'n't you kick'em out?" 
 
 "I di'n't care much," said Crooks. "Lennie's a nice fella." 
 
 Now Candy aroused himself. "Oh, George! I been figurin' and

--- Chunk 3 ---
"He's in here," Crooks said shortly. He went back to his bunk and 
lay down. 
 
 Candy stood in the doorway scratching his bald wrist and looking 
blindly into the lighted room. He made no attempt to enter. "Tell 
ya what, Lennie. I been figuring out about them rabbits." 
 
 Crooks said irritably, "You can come in if you want." 
 
 Candy seemed embarrassed. "I do' know. 'Course, if ya want me 
to." 
 
 "Come on in. If ever'body's comin' in, you might just as well." It

--- Chunk 4 ---
to." 
 
 "Come on in. If ever'body's comin' in, you might just as well." It 
was difficult for Crooks to conceal his pleasure with anger. 
 
 Candy came in, but he was still embarrassed. "You got a nice cozy 
little place in here," he said to Crooks. "Must be nice to have a 
room all to yourself this way." 
 
 "Sure," said Crooks. "And a manure pile under the window. Sure,

--- Chunk 5 ---
it's swell." 
 
 Lennie broke in, "You said about them rabbits." 
 
 Candy leaned against the wall beside the broken collar while he 
scratched the wrist stump. "I been here a long time," he said. "An' 
Crooks been here a long time. This's the first time I ever been in 
his room." 
 
 Crooks said darkly, "Guys don't come into a colored man's room 
very much. Nobody been here but Slim. Slim an' the boss." 
 
 Candy quickly changed the subject. "Slim's as good a skinner as I 
ever seen."

--- Chunk 6 ---
paused. 
 
 His voice grew soft and persuasive. "S'pose George don't come 
back no more. S'pose he took a powder and just ain't coming back. 
What'll you do then?" 
 
 Lennie's attention came gradually to what had been said. "What?" 
he demanded. 
 
 "I said s'pose George went into town tonight and you never heard 
of him no more." Crooks pressed forward some kind of private 
victory. "Just s'pose that," he repeated. 
 
 "He won't do it," Lennie cried. "George wouldn't do nothing like

--- Chunk 7 ---
"Nothing-I seen your light. I thought I could jus' come in an' set." 
 
 Crooks stared at Lennie, and he reached behind him and took 
down the spectacles and adjusted them over his pink ears and 
stared again. "I don't know what you're doin' in the barn anyway," 
he complained. "You ain't no skinner. They's no call for a bucker to 
come into the barn at all. You ain't no skinner. You ain't got 
nothing to do with the horses." 
 
 "The pup," Lennie repeated "I come to see my pup."

--- Chunk 8 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

--- Chunk 9 ---
Crooks settled himself more comfortably on his bunk. "Set down," 
he invited. "Set down on the nail keg." 
 
 Lennie hunched down on the little barrel. "You think it's a lie," 
Lennie said, "But it ain't no lie. Ever' word's the truth, an' you can

--- Chunk 10 ---
his arm in a sling-an' if Curley gets tough, you can break his other 
han'. You didn't put nothing over on me about gettin' it caught in 
no machine." 
 
 But Lennie was not to be drawn. "No, sir. I ain't gonna talk to you 
or nothing." 
 
 She knelt in the hay beside him. "Listen," she said "All the guys 
got a horseshoe tenement goin' on. It' on'y about four o'clock. None 
of them guys is goin to leave that tenement. Why can't I talk to

--- Chunk 11 ---
machines." 
 
 Candy broke in. "You let this guy alone. Don't you do no messing 
aroun' with him. I'm gonna tell George what you says. George 
won't have you messin' with Lennie." 
 
 "Who's George?" she asked. "The little guy you come with?" 
 
 Lennie smiled happily. "That's him," he said. "That's the guy, an' 
he's gonna let me tend the rabbits." 
 
 "Well, if that's all you want, I might get a couple rabbits myself." 
 
 Crooks stood up from his bunk and faced her. "I had enough," he

--- Chunk 12 ---
nothing to do with the horses." 
 
 "The pup," Lennie repeated "I come to see my pup." 
 
 "Well, go see your pup, then. Don't come in a place where you're 
not wanted." 
 
 Lennie lost his smile. He advanced a step into the room, then 
remembered and backed to the door again. "I looked at 'em a little.

--- Chunk 13 ---
dollars." His tone grew decisive. "You keep away from Curley, 
Lennie." 
 
 "Sure I will, George. I won't say a word." 
 
 "Don't let him pull you in-but-if the son-of-abitch socks you-let 'im 
have it." 
 
 "Let 'im have what, George?" 
 
 "Never mind, never mind. I'll tell you when. I hate that kind of a 
guy. Look, Lennie, if you get in any kind of trouble, you remember 
what I told you to do?" 
 
 Lennie raised up on his elbow. His face contorted with thought.

--- Chunk 14 ---
"George ain't hurt. He's all right. He'll be back all right." 
 
 Lennie stood over him. "What you supposin' for? Ain't nobody 
goin' to suppose no hurt to George." 
 
 Crooks removed his glasses and wiped his eyes with his fingers. 
"Jus' set down," he said. "George ain't hurt." 
 
 Lennie growled back to his seat on the nail keg. "Ain't nobody 
goin' to talk no hurt to George," he grumbled. 
 
 Crooks said gently, "Maybe you can see now. You got George.

--- Chunk 15 ---
Lennie stuck out his hands. 
 
 "Christ awmighty, I hate to have you mad at me," Slim said. 
 
 George broke in, "Lennie was jus' scairt," he explained. "He didn't 
know what to do. I told you nobody ought never to fight him. No, I 
guess it was Candy I told." 
 
 Candy nodded solemnly. "That's jus' what you done," he said. 
"Right this morning when Curley first lit into your fren', you says, 
'He better not fool with Lennie if he knows what's good for 'um.'


=== Question 33 ===
According to Crooks, why does a person need a companion?

for, being alone, Crooks could leave his things about, and being a

"You're nuts," said Crooks. "You're crazy as a wedge. What 
rabbits you talkin' about?" 
 
 "The rabbits we're gonna get, and I get to tend 'em, cut grass an' 
give 'em water, an' like that." 
 
 "Jus' nuts," said Crooks. "I don't blame the guy you travel with for 
keepin' you outa sight." 
 
 Lennie said quietly, "It ain't no lie. We're gonna do it. Gonna get a 
little place an' live on the fatta the lan'."

 Crooks put his dark chin into his pink palm. "You travel aroun' 
with George, don't ya?" 
 
 "Sure. Me an' him goes ever' place together." 
 
 Crooks continued. "Sometimes he talks, and you don't know what 
the hell he's talkin' about. Ain't that so?" He leaned forward, 
boring Lennie with his deep eyes. "Ain't that so?" 
 
 "Yeah . . . . sometimes." 
 
 "Jus' talks on, an' you don't know what the hell it's all about?" 
 
 "Yeah . . . . sometimes. But . . . . not always."

somebody's out there," Crooks said. "Maybe Slim. Slim comes in 
sometimes two, three times a night. Slim's a real skinner. He 
looks out for his team." He pulled himself painfully upright and 
moved toward the door. "That you, Slim?" he called. 
 
 Candy's voice answered. "Slim went in town. Say, you seen 
Lennie?" 
 
 "Ya mean the big guy?" 
 
 "Yeah. Seen him around any place?" 
 
 "He's in here," Crooks said shortly. He went back to his bunk and 
lay down.

 "Oh, she don't care. She lets me." Lennie had moved into the room 
again.

=== Question 34 ===
What is Crooks's initial response to Candy's account of the dream farm and what evidence is there that his attitude changes?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Candy and Lennie stood up and went toward the door. Crooks 
called, "Candy!" 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "'Member what I said about hoein' and doin' odd jobs?" 
 
 "Yeah," said Candy. "I remember." 
 
 "Well, jus' forget it," said Crooks. "I didn' mean it. Jus' foolin'. I 
wouldn' want to go no place like that." 
 
 "Well, O.K., if you feel like that. Good-night"

--- Chunk 2 ---
'em. He promised." 
 
 Crooks interrupted brutally. "You guys is just kiddin' yourself. 
You'll talk about it a hell of a lot, but you won't get no land. You'll 
be a swamper here till they take you out in a box. Hell, I seen too 
many guys. Lennie here'll quit an' be on the road in two, three 
weeks. Seems like ever' guy got land in his head." 
 
 Candy rubbed his cheek angrily. "You God damn right we're 
gonna do it. George says we are. We got the money right now."

--- Chunk 3 ---
"You're nuts," said Crooks. "You're crazy as a wedge. What 
rabbits you talkin' about?" 
 
 "The rabbits we're gonna get, and I get to tend 'em, cut grass an' 
give 'em water, an' like that." 
 
 "Jus' nuts," said Crooks. "I don't blame the guy you travel with for 
keepin' you outa sight." 
 
 Lennie said quietly, "It ain't no lie. We're gonna do it. Gonna get a 
little place an' live on the fatta the lan'." 
 
 Crooks settled himself more comfortably on his bunk. "Set down,"

--- Chunk 4 ---
somebody's out there," Crooks said. "Maybe Slim. Slim comes in 
sometimes two, three times a night. Slim's a real skinner. He 
looks out for his team." He pulled himself painfully upright and 
moved toward the door. "That you, Slim?" he called. 
 
 Candy's voice answered. "Slim went in town. Say, you seen 
Lennie?" 
 
 "Ya mean the big guy?" 
 
 "Yeah. Seen him around any place?" 
 
 "He's in here," Crooks said shortly. He went back to his bunk and 
lay down.

--- Chunk 5 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 6 ---
"I guess maybe way back in my head I did." 
 
 Candy asked, "What we gonna do now, George? What we gonna 
do now?" 
 
 George was a long time in answering. "Guess . . . . we gotta tell 
the . . . . guys. I guess we gotta get 'im an' lock 'im up. We can't let 
'im get away. Why, the poor bastard'd starve." And he tried to 
reassure himself. "Maybe they'll lock 'im up an' be nice to In."

--- Chunk 7 ---
But Candy said excitedly, "We oughtta let'im get away. You don't 
know that Curley. Curley gon'ta wanta get 'im lynched. Curley'll 
get 'im killed." 
 
 George watched Candy's lips. "Yeah," he said at last, "that's right, 
Curley will. An' the other guys will." And he looked back at 
Curley's wife. 
 
 Now Candy spoke his greatest fear. "You an' me can get that little 
place, can't we, George? You an' me can go there an' live nice, can't 
we, George? Can't we?"

--- Chunk 8 ---
Crooks bored in on him. "Want me to tell ya what'll happen? 
They'll take ya to the booby hatch. They'll tie ya up with a collar, 
like a dog." 
 
 Suddenly Lennie's eyes. centered and grew quiet, and mad. He 
stood up and walked dangerously toward Crooks. "Who hurt 
George?" he demanded. 
 
 Crooks saw the danger as it approached him. He edged back on 
his bunk to get out of the way. "I was just supposin'," he said. 
"George ain't hurt. He's all right. He'll be back all right."

--- Chunk 9 ---
and I'll come along and make like I never seen her. Will you do 
that? So the guys won't think I was in on it?" 
 
 Candy said, "Sure, George. Sure I'll do that." 
 
 "O.K. Give me a couple minutes then, and you come runnin' out 
an' tell like you jus' found her. I'm going now." George turned and 
went quickly out of the barn. 
 
 Old Candy watched him go. He looked helplessly back at Curley's 
wife, and gradually his sorrow and his anger grew into words.

--- Chunk 10 ---
place, can't we, George? You an' me can go there an' live nice, can't 
we, George? Can't we?" 
 
 Before George answered, Candy dropped his head and looked 
down at the hay. He knew. 
 
 George said softly, "-I think I knowed from the very first I think I 
knowed we'd never do her. He usta like to hear about it so much I 
got to thinking maybe we would." 
 
 "Then-it's all off?" Candy said sulkily. 
 
 George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my

halter chains clinked. Outside, the men's voices became louder 
and clearer. 
 
 From around the end of the last stall old Candy's voice came. 
"Lennie," he called. "Oh, Lennie! You in here? 1 been figuring 
some more. Tell you what we can do, Lennie." Old Candy appeared

--- Chunk 12 ---
George moved slowly after them, and his feet dragged heavily. 
 
 And when they were gone, Candy squatted down in the hay and 
watched the face of Curley's wife. "Poor bastard," he said softly. 
 
 The sound of the men grew fainter. The barn was darkening 
gradually and, in their stalls, the horses shifted their feet and 
rattled the halter chains. Old Candy lay down in the hay and 
covered his eyes with his arm. 
 
   
 
   
 
   
 
   
 CHAPTER  6

--- Chunk 13 ---
Candy cried, "Sure they all want it. Everybody wants a little bit of 
land, not much. Jus' som'thin' that was his. Som'thin' he could live 
on and there couldn't nobody throw him off of it. I never had none. 
I planted crops for damn near ever'body in this state, but they 
wasn't my crops, and when I harvested 'em, it wasn't none of any 
harvest. But we gonna do it now, and don't you make no mistake 
about that. George ain't got the money in town. That money's in

Slim says I ain't to pet 'em very much." 
 
 Crooks said, "Well, you been takin' 'em out of the nest all the 
time. I wonder the old lady don't move 'em someplace else." 
 
 "Oh, she don't care. She lets me." Lennie had moved into the room 
again. 
 
 Crooks scowled, but Lennie's disarming smile defeated him. 
"Come on in and set a while," Crooks said. "'Long as you won't get 
out and leave me alone, you might as well set down." His tone was

--- Chunk 15 ---
I wasn't drunk. I don't know if I was asleep. If some guy was with 
me, he could tell me I was asleep, an' then it would be all right. 
But I jus' don't know." Crooks was looking across the room now, 
looking toward the window. 
 
 Lennie said miserably, "George won't go away and leave me. I 
know George wun't do that." 
 
 The stable buck went on dreamily, "I remember when I was a 
little kid on my old man's chicken ranch. Had two brothers. They


=== Question 35 ===
According to Curley's wife, why are the men afraid to talk to her when there is more than one present?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Curley's wife moved away from him a little. "I think you're nuts," 
she said. 
 
 "No I ain't," Lennie explained earnestly. "George says I ain't. I 
like to pet nice things with my fingers, sof' things. " 
 
 She was a little bit reassured. "Well, who don't?" she said. 
"Ever'body likes that. I like to feel silk an' velvet. Do you like to 
feel velvet?" 
 
 Lennie chuckled with pleasure. "You bet, by God," he cried 
happily. "An' I had some, too. A lady give me some, an' that lady

--- Chunk 2 ---
got that letter," she said. "I always thought my of lady stole it. 
Well, I wasn't gonna stay no place where I couldn't get nowhere or 
make something of myself, an' where they stole your letters. I ast 
her if she stole it, too, an' she says no. So I married Curley. Met 
him out to the Riverside Dance Palace that same night." She 
demanded, "You listenin'?" 
 
 "Me? Sure." 
 
 "Well, I ain't told this to nobody before. Maybe I ought'n to. I

--- Chunk 3 ---
Curley's got yella-jackets in his drawers, but that's all so far. Ever' 
time the guys is around she shows up. She's lookin' for Curley, or 
she thought she lef' sotnethin' layin' around and she's lookin' for 
it. Seems like she can't keep away from guys. An' Curley's pants is 
just crawlin' with ants, but they ain't nothing come of it yet." 
 
 George said, "She's gonna make a mess. They's gonna be a bad 
mess about her. She's a jail bait all set on the trigger. That Curley

--- Chunk 4 ---
But Candy said excitedly, "We oughtta let'im get away. You don't 
know that Curley. Curley gon'ta wanta get 'im lynched. Curley'll 
get 'im killed." 
 
 George watched Candy's lips. "Yeah," he said at last, "that's right, 
Curley will. An' the other guys will." And he looked back at 
Curley's wife. 
 
 Now Candy spoke his greatest fear. "You an' me can get that little 
place, can't we, George? You an' me can go there an' live nice, can't 
we, George? Can't we?"

--- Chunk 5 ---
looked sullenly up at her.She said, "What you got there, sonny 
boy?" 
 
 Lennie glared at her. "George says I ain't to have nothing to do 
with you-talk to you or nothing." 
 
 She laughed "George giving you orders about everything?" 
 
 Lennie looked down at the hay. "Says I can't tend no rabbits if I 
talk to you or anything." 
 
 She said quietly, "He's scared Curley'll get mad. Well, Curley got 
his arm in a sling-an' if Curley gets tough, you can break his other

--- Chunk 6 ---
"Me? Sure." 
 
 "Well, I ain't told this to nobody before. Maybe I ought'n to. I 
don'like Curley. He ain't a nice fella." And because she had 
confided in him, she moved closer to Lennie and sat beside him. 
"Coulda been in the movies, an' had nice clothes-all them nice

buttoned it, and his black hat was pulled down low over his eyes. 
The men raced around the last stall. Their eyes found Curley's 
wife in the gloom, they stopped and stood still and looked. 
 
 Then Slim went quietly over to her, and he felt her wrist. One 
lean finger touched her cheek, and then his hand went under her 
slightly twisted neck and his fingers explored her neck. When he 
stood up the men crowded near and the spell was broken.

--- Chunk 8 ---
Slim said, "Well, you been askin' me too often. I'm gettin' God 
damn sick of it. If you can't look after your own God damn wife, 
what you expect me to do about it? You lay offa me." 
 
 "I'm jus' tryin' to tell you I didn't mean nothing," said Curley. "I 
jus' thought you might of saw her." 
 
 "Why'n't you tell her to stay the hell home where she belongs?" 
said Carlson. "You let her hang around bunk houses and pretty 
soon you're gonna have som'pin on your hands and you won't be

under the look and shifted his feet nervously. Curley stepped 
gingerly close to him. "You the new guys the old man was waitin' 
for?" 
 
 "We just come in," said George. 
 
 "Let the big gay talk." 
 
 Lennie twisted with embarrassment. 
 
 George said, "S’pose he don't want to talk?" 
 
 Curley lashed his body around. "By Christ,' he's gotta talk when 
he’s spoke to. What the hell are you gettin’ into it for?" 
 
 "We travel together," said George coldly.

--- Chunk 10 ---
an' lend a hand. I ain't so crippled I can't work like a son-of-a-bitch 
if I want to." 
 
 "Any you boys seen Curley?" 
 
 They swung their heads toward the door. Looking in was Curley's 
wife. Her face was heavily made up. Her lips were slightly parted. 
She breathed strongly, as though she had been running. 
 
 "Curley ain't been here," Candy said sourly. 
 
 She stood still in the doorway, smiling a little at them, rubbing 
the nails of one hand with the thumb and forefinger of the other.

--- Chunk 11 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

--- Chunk 12 ---
bunk house, and she hurried away. 
 
 George looked around at Lennie. "Jesus, what a tramp," he said. 
"So that's what Curley picks for a wife." 
 
 "She's purty," said Lennie defensively. 
 
 "Yeah, and she's sure hidin' it. Curley got his work ahead of him. 
Bet she'd clear out for twenty bucks." 
 
 Lennie still stared at the doorway where she had been. "Gosh, she 
was purty." He smiled admiringly. George looked quickly down at 
him and then he took him by an ear and shook him.

--- Chunk 13 ---
George." 
 
 Curley's wife came around the end of the last stall. She came very 
quietly, so that Lennie didn't see her. She wore her bright cotton 
dress and the mules with the red ostrich feathers. Her face was 
made up and the little sausage curls were all in place. She was 
quite near to him before Lennie looked up and saw her. 
 
 In a panic he shoveled hay over the puppy with his fingers. He 
looked sullenly up at her.She said, "What you got there, sonny 
boy?"

"You're all scared of each other, that's what. Ever' one of you's 
scared the rest is goin' to get something on you." 
 
 After a pause Crooks said, "Maybe you better go along to your 
own house now. We don't want no trouble." 
 
 "Well, I ain't giving you no trouble. Think I don't like to talk to 
somebody ever' once in a while? Think I like to stick in that house 
afla time?"

her give Carlson the eye." 
 
 George pretended a lack of interest. "Looks like we was gonna 
have fun." 
 
 The swamper stood up from his box. "Know what I think?" George 
did not answer. "Well, I think Curley's married . . . . a tart." 
 
 "He ain't the first," said George. "There's plenty done that." 
 
 The old man moved toward the door, and his ancient dog lifted his

Why doesn't Curley's wife like talking to her husband?

 "No I ain't," Lennie explained earnestly. "George says I ain't. I 
like to pet nice things with my fingers, sof' things. " 
 
 She was a little bit reassured. "Well, who don't?" she said. 
"Ever'body likes that. I like to feel silk an' velvet. Do you like to 
feel velvet?" 
 
 Lennie chuckled with pleasure. "You bet, by God," he cried 
happily. "An' I had some, too. A lady give me some, an' that lady

--- Chunk 8 ---
an' lend a hand. I ain't so crippled I can't work like a son-of-a-bitch 
if I want to." 
 
 "Any you boys seen Curley?" 
 
 They swung their heads toward the door. Looking in was Curley's 
wife. Her face was heavily made up. Her lips were slightly parted. 
She breathed strongly, as though she had been running. 
 
 "Curley ain't been here," Candy said sourly. 
 
 She stood still in the doorway, smiling a little at them, rubbing 
the nails of one hand with the thumb and forefinger of the other.

--- Chunk 9 ---
looked sullenly up at her.She said, "What you got there, sonny 
boy?" 
 
 Lennie glared at her. "George says I ain't to have nothing to do 
with you-talk to you or nothing." 
 
 She laughed "George giving you orders about everything?" 
 
 Lennie looked down at the hay. "Says I can't tend no rabbits if I 
talk to you or anything." 
 
 She said quietly, "He's scared Curley'll get mad. Well, Curley got 
his arm in a sling-an' if Curley gets tough, you can break his other

--- Chunk 10 ---
Candy and Lennie stood up and went toward the door. Crooks 
called, "Candy!" 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "'Member what I said about hoein' and doin' odd jobs?" 
 
 "Yeah," said Candy. "I remember." 
 
 "Well, jus' forget it," said Crooks. "I didn' mean it. Jus' foolin'. I 
wouldn' want to go no place like that." 
 
 "Well, O.K., if you feel like that. Good-night"

--- Chunk 11 ---
with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at ’em because he ain’t a big 
guy. You seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?" 
 
 "Sure," said George. "I seen plenty tough little guys. But this 
Curley better not make no mistakes about Lennie. Lennie ain’t 
handy, but this Curley punk is gonna get' hurt if he messes

--- Chunk 12 ---
we'll shoot 'im. " 
 
 George said weakly, "Maybe Carlson lost his gun.,, 
 
 "I seen it this morning," said Carlson. "No, it's been took." 
 
 Slim stood looking down at Curley's wife. He said, "Curley-maybe 
you better stay here with your wife." 
 
 Curley's face reddened. "I'm goin'," he said. "I'm gonna shoot the 
guts outa that big bastard myself, even if I only got one hand. I'm 
gonna get 'im." 
 
 Slim turned to Candy. "You stay here with her then, Candy. The

--- Chunk 13 ---
gonna get 'im." 
 
 Slim turned to Candy. "You stay here with her then, Candy. The 
rest of us better get goin'." 
 
 They moved away. George stopped a moment beside Candy and 
they both looked down at the dead girl until Curley called, "You 
George! You stick with us so we don't think you had nothin' to do 
with this."

--- Chunk 14 ---
"I guess maybe way back in my head I did." 
 
 Candy asked, "What we gonna do now, George? What we gonna 
do now?" 
 
 George was a long time in answering. "Guess . . . . we gotta tell 
the . . . . guys. I guess we gotta get 'im an' lock 'im up. We can't let 
'im get away. Why, the poor bastard'd starve." And he tried to 
reassure himself. "Maybe they'll lock 'im up an' be nice to In."

--- Chunk 15 ---
he said quietly. "If you go right now, we won't tell Curley you was 
here." 
 
 She appraised him coolly. "I ain't sure you heard nothing." 
 
 "Better not take no chances," he said. "If you ain't sure, you better 
take the safe way." 
 
 She turned to Lennie. "I'm glad you bust up Curley a little bit. He 
got it comin' to him. Sometimes I'd like to bust him myself." She 
slipped out the door and disappeared into the dark barn. And


=== Question 38 ===
What makes Crooks so bold as to confront Curley's wife and tell her to leave his room?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Curley's got yella-jackets in his drawers, but that's all so far. Ever' 
time the guys is around she shows up. She's lookin' for Curley, or 
she thought she lef' sotnethin' layin' around and she's lookin' for 
it. Seems like she can't keep away from guys. An' Curley's pants is 
just crawlin' with ants, but they ain't nothing come of it yet." 
 
 George said, "She's gonna make a mess. They's gonna be a bad 
mess about her. She's a jail bait all set on the trigger. That Curley

--- Chunk 2 ---
Slim said, "Well, you been askin' me too often. I'm gettin' God 
damn sick of it. If you can't look after your own God damn wife, 
what you expect me to do about it? You lay offa me." 
 
 "I'm jus' tryin' to tell you I didn't mean nothing," said Curley. "I 
jus' thought you might of saw her." 
 
 "Why'n't you tell her to stay the hell home where she belongs?" 
said Carlson. "You let her hang around bunk houses and pretty 
soon you're gonna have som'pin on your hands and you won't be

--- Chunk 3 ---
Crooks stood up from his bunk and faced her. "I had enough," he 
said coldly. "You got no rights comin' in a colored man's room. You 
got no rights messing around in here at all. Now you jus' get out, 
an' get out quick. If you don't, I'm gonna ast the boss not to ever 
let you come in the barn no more."

--- Chunk 4 ---
bunk house, and she hurried away. 
 
 George looked around at Lennie. "Jesus, what a tramp," he said. 
"So that's what Curley picks for a wife." 
 
 "She's purty," said Lennie defensively. 
 
 "Yeah, and she's sure hidin' it. Curley got his work ahead of him. 
Bet she'd clear out for twenty bucks." 
 
 Lennie still stared at the doorway where she had been. "Gosh, she 
was purty." He smiled admiringly. George looked quickly down at 
him and then he took him by an ear and shook him.

--- Chunk 5 ---
Slim says I ain't to pet 'em very much." 
 
 Crooks said, "Well, you been takin' 'em out of the nest all the 
time. I wonder the old lady don't move 'em someplace else." 
 
 "Oh, she don't care. She lets me." Lennie had moved into the room 
again. 
 
 Crooks scowled, but Lennie's disarming smile defeated him. 
"Come on in and set a while," Crooks said. "'Long as you won't get 
out and leave me alone, you might as well set down." His tone was

Well, I wasn't gonna stay no place where I couldn't get nowhere or 
make something of myself, an' where they stole your letters. I ast 
her if she stole it, too, an' she says no. So I married Curley. Met 
him out to the Riverside Dance Palace that same night." She 
demanded, "You listenin'?" 
 
 "Me? Sure." 
 
 "Well, I ain't told this to nobody before. Maybe I ought'n to. I

--- Chunk 7 ---
mad" She dropped her fingers and put her hands on her hips. 
"You're all scared of each other, that's what. Ever' one of you's 
scared the rest is goin' to get something on you." 
 
 After a pause Crooks said, "Maybe you better go along to your 
own house now. We don't want no trouble." 
 
 "Well, I ain't giving you no trouble. Think I don't like to talk to 
somebody ever' once in a while? Think I like to stick in that house 
afla time?"

--- Chunk 8 ---
he said quietly. "If you go right now, we won't tell Curley you was 
here." 
 
 She appraised him coolly. "I ain't sure you heard nothing." 
 
 "Better not take no chances," he said. "If you ain't sure, you better 
take the safe way." 
 
 She turned to Lennie. "I'm glad you bust up Curley a little bit. He 
got it comin' to him. Sometimes I'd like to bust him myself." She 
slipped out the door and disappeared into the dark barn. And

--- Chunk 9 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

--- Chunk 10 ---
Crooks bored in on him. "Want me to tell ya what'll happen? 
They'll take ya to the booby hatch. They'll tie ya up with a collar, 
like a dog." 
 
 Suddenly Lennie's eyes. centered and grew quiet, and mad. He 
stood up and walked dangerously toward Crooks. "Who hurt 
George?" he demanded. 
 
 Crooks saw the danger as it approached him. He edged back on 
his bunk to get out of the way. "I was just supposin'," he said. 
"George ain't hurt. He's all right. He'll be back all right."

--- Chunk 11 ---
around the end of the last stall. "Oh, Lennie!" he called again; and 
then he stopped, and his body stiffened. He rubbed his smooth 
wrist on his white stubble whiskers. "I di'n't know you was here," 
he said to Curley's wife. 
 
 When she didn't answer, he stepped nearer. "You oughten to sleep 
out here," he said disapprovingly; and then he was beside her and-
"Oh, Jesus Christ!" He looked about helplessly, and he rubbed his 
beard. And then he jumped up and went quickly out of the barn.

--- Chunk 12 ---
somebody's out there," Crooks said. "Maybe Slim. Slim comes in 
sometimes two, three times a night. Slim's a real skinner. He 
looks out for his team." He pulled himself painfully upright and 
moved toward the door. "That you, Slim?" he called. 
 
 Candy's voice answered. "Slim went in town. Say, you seen 
Lennie?" 
 
 "Ya mean the big guy?" 
 
 "Yeah. Seen him around any place?" 
 
 "He's in here," Crooks said shortly. He went back to his bunk and 
lay down.

--- Chunk 13 ---
She turned on him in scorn. "Listen, Nigger," she said. "You know 
what I can do to you if you open. your trap?" 
 
 Crooks stared hopelessly at her, and then he sat down on his 
bunk and drew into himself. 
 
 She closed on him. "You know what I could do?" 
 
 Crooks seemed to grow smaller, and he pressed? himself against 
the wall. "Yes, ma'am." 
 
 "Well, you keep your place then, Nigger. I could get you strung up 
on a tree so easy it ain't even funny."

--- Chunk 14 ---
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George." 
 
 George got up and went over to Lennie's bunk and sat down on it. 
"I hate that kinda bastard," he said. "I seen plenty of 'em. Like the 
old guy says, Curley don't take no chances. He always wins." He 
thought for a moment. "If he tangles with you, Lennie, we're 
gonna get the can. Don't make no mistake about that. He's the 
boss's son. Look, Lennie. You try to keep away from him, will you?

--- Chunk 15 ---
and I'll come along and make like I never seen her. Will you do 
that? So the guys won't think I was in on it?" 
 
 Candy said, "Sure, George. Sure I'll do that." 
 
 "O.K. Give me a couple minutes then, and you come runnin' out 
an' tell like you jus' found her. I'm going now." George turned and 
went quickly out of the barn. 
 
 Old Candy watched him go. He looked helplessly back at Curley's 
wife, and gradually his sorrow and his anger grew into words.


=== Question 39 ===
How does Candy finally make Curley's wife leave the barn?

--- Chunk 1 ---
and I'll come along and make like I never seen her. Will you do 
that? So the guys won't think I was in on it?" 
 
 Candy said, "Sure, George. Sure I'll do that." 
 
 "O.K. Give me a couple minutes then, and you come runnin' out 
an' tell like you jus' found her. I'm going now." George turned and 
went quickly out of the barn. 
 
 Old Candy watched him go. He looked helplessly back at Curley's

he said quietly. "If you go right now, we won't tell Curley you was

 She appraised him coolly. "I ain't sure you heard nothing." 
 
 "Better not take no chances," he said. "If you ain't sure, you better

 She turned to Lennie. "I'm glad you bust up Curley a little bit. He 
got it comin' to him. Sometimes I'd like to bust him myself." She 
slipped out the door and disappeared into the dark barn. And

--- Chunk 3 ---
But Candy said excitedly, "We oughtta let'im get away. You don't 
know that Curley. Curley gon'ta wanta get 'im lynched. Curley'll 
get 'im killed." 
 
 George watched Candy's lips. "Yeah," he said at last, "that's right, 
Curley will. An' the other guys will." And he looked back at 
Curley's wife. 
 
 Now Candy spoke his greatest fear. "You an' me can get that little 
place, can't we, George? You an' me can go there an' live nice, can't 
we, George? Can't we?"

--- Chunk 4 ---
George moved slowly after them, and his feet dragged heavily. 
 
 And when they were gone, Candy squatted down in the hay and 
watched the face of Curley's wife. "Poor bastard," he said softly. 
 
 The sound of the men grew fainter. The barn was darkening 
gradually and, in their stalls, the horses shifted their feet and 
rattled the halter chains. Old Candy lay down in the hay and 
covered his eyes with his arm.

bunk house, and she hurried away. 
 
 George looked around at Lennie. "Jesus, what a tramp," he said. 
"So that's what Curley picks for a wife." 
 
 "She's purty," said Lennie defensively. 
 
 "Yeah, and she's sure hidin' it. Curley got his work ahead of him.

beard. And then he jumped up and went quickly out of the barn. 
 
 But the barn was alive now. The horses stamped and snorted, and 
they chewed the straw of their bedding and they clashed the 
chains of their halters. In a moment Candy came back, and 
George was with him. 
 
 George said, "What was it you wanted to see me about?" 
 
 Candy pointed at Curley's wife. George stared. "What's the 
matter with her?" he asked. He stepped closer, and then he echoed

--- Chunk 7 ---
an' lend a hand. I ain't so crippled I can't work like a son-of-a-bitch 
if I want to." 
 
 "Any you boys seen Curley?" 
 
 They swung their heads toward the door. Looking in was Curley's 
wife. Her face was heavily made up. Her lips were slightly parted. 
She breathed strongly, as though she had been running. 
 
 "Curley ain't been here," Candy said sourly. 
 
 She stood still in the doorway, smiling a little at them, rubbing 
the nails of one hand with the thumb and forefinger of the other.

--- Chunk 8 ---
slipped out the door and disappeared into the dark barn. And 
while she went through the barn, the halter chains rattled, and 
some horses snorted and some stamped their feet. 
 
 Crooks seemed to come slowly out of the layers of protection he 
bad put on. "Was that the truth what you said about the guys 
come back?" he asked. 
 
 "Sure. I heard 'em." 
 
 "Well, I didn't hear nothing." 
 
 "The gate banged," Candy said, and he went on, "Jesus Christ,

--- Chunk 9 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 10 ---
Curley's got yella-jackets in his drawers, but that's all so far. Ever'

 Lennie glared at her. "George says I ain't to have nothing to do

 She laughed "George giving you orders about everything?" 
 
 Lennie looked down at the hay. "Says I can't tend no rabbits if I 
talk to you or anything." 
 
 She said quietly, "He's scared Curley'll get mad. Well, Curley got 
his arm in a sling-an' if Curley gets tough, you can break his other

--- Chunk 12 ---
George." 
 
 Curley's wife came around the end of the last stall. She came very 
quietly, so that Lennie didn't see her. She wore her bright cotton 
dress and the mules with the red ostrich feathers. Her face was 
made up and the little sausage curls were all in place. She was 
quite near to him before Lennie looked up and saw her. 
 
 In a panic he shoveled hay over the puppy with his fingers. He 
looked sullenly up at her.She said, "What you got there, sonny 
boy?"

--- Chunk 13 ---
around the end of the last stall. "Oh, Lennie!" he called again; and 
then he stopped, and his body stiffened. He rubbed his smooth 
wrist on his white stubble whiskers. "I di'n't know you was here," 
he said to Curley's wife. 
 
 When she didn't answer, he stepped nearer. "You oughten to sleep

"Oh, Jesus Christ!" He looked about helplessly, and he rubbed his 
beard. And then he jumped up and went quickly out of the barn.

--- Chunk 14 ---
Curley's wife moved away from him a little. "I think you're nuts," 
she said. 
 
 "No I ain't," Lennie explained earnestly. "George says I ain't. I 
like to pet nice things with my fingers, sof' things. " 
 
 She was a little bit reassured. "Well, who don't?" she said. 
"Ever'body likes that. I like to feel silk an' velvet. Do you like to 
feel velvet?" 
 
 Lennie chuckled with pleasure. "You bet, by God," he cried 
happily. "An' I had some, too. A lady give me some, an' that lady

along her spine. She whimpered and cringed to the packing box, 
and jumped in among the puppies. 
 
 Curley's wife lay with a half-covering of yellow hay. And the 
meanness and the plannings and the discontent and the ache for 
attention were all gone from her face. She was very pretty and 
simple, and her face was sweet and young. Now her rouged cheeks 
and her reddened lips made her seem alive and sleeping very 
lightly. The curls, tiny little sausages, were spread on the hay


=== Question 40 ===
What does George say about Candy and Lennie visiting with Crooks?

--- Chunk 1 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 2 ---
Candy and Lennie stood up and went toward the door. Crooks 
called, "Candy!" 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "'Member what I said about hoein' and doin' odd jobs?" 
 
 "Yeah," said Candy. "I remember." 
 
 "Well, jus' forget it," said Crooks. "I didn' mean it. Jus' foolin'. I 
wouldn' want to go no place like that." 
 
 "Well, O.K., if you feel like that. Good-night"

--- Chunk 3 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

--- Chunk 4 ---
But Candy said excitedly, "We oughtta let'im get away. You don't 
know that Curley. Curley gon'ta wanta get 'im lynched. Curley'll 
get 'im killed." 
 
 George watched Candy's lips. "Yeah," he said at last, "that's right, 
Curley will. An' the other guys will." And he looked back at 
Curley's wife. 
 
 Now Candy spoke his greatest fear. "You an' me can get that little 
place, can't we, George? You an' me can go there an' live nice, can't 
we, George? Can't we?"

--- Chunk 5 ---
Crooks bored in on him. "Want me to tell ya what'll happen? 
They'll take ya to the booby hatch. They'll tie ya up with a collar, 
like a dog." 
 
 Suddenly Lennie's eyes. centered and grew quiet, and mad. He 
stood up and walked dangerously toward Crooks. "Who hurt 
George?" he demanded. 
 
 Crooks saw the danger as it approached him. He edged back on 
his bunk to get out of the way. "I was just supposin'," he said. 
"George ain't hurt. He's all right. He'll be back all right."

--- Chunk 6 ---
said. "A guy can go in an' get drunk and get ever'thing outa his 
system all at once, an' no messes. And he knows how much it's 
gonna set him back. These here jail baits is just set on the trigger 
of the hoosegow." 
 
 Lennie followed his words admiringly, and moved his lips a little 
to keep up. George continued, "You remember Andy Cushman, 
Lennie? Went to grammar school?" 
 
 "The one that his old lady used to make hot cakes for the kids?" 
Lennie asked.

--- Chunk 7 ---
'em. He promised." 
 
 Crooks interrupted brutally. "You guys is just kiddin' yourself. 
You'll talk about it a hell of a lot, but you won't get no land. You'll 
be a swamper here till they take you out in a box. Hell, I seen too 
many guys. Lennie here'll quit an' be on the road in two, three 
weeks. Seems like ever' guy got land in his head." 
 
 Candy rubbed his cheek angrily. "You God damn right we're 
gonna do it. George says we are. We got the money right now."

--- Chunk 8 ---
"He won't do it," Lennie cried. "George wouldn't do nothing like 
that. I been with George a long time. He'll come back tonight-" But 
the doubt was too much for him. "Don't you think he will?" 
 
 Crooks' face lighted with pleasure in his torture. 
 
 "Nobody can't tell what a guy'll do," he observed calmly. "Le's say 
he wants to come back and can't. S'pose he gets killed or hurt so 
he can't come back." 
 
 Lennie struggled to understand. "George won't do nothing like

hand. He put an ace up on his scoring rack and piled a two, three 
and four of diamonds on it. "Andy's in San Quentin right now on 
account of a tart," said George. 
 
 Lennie drummed on the table with his fingers. "George?" 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "George, how long's it gonna be till we get that little place an' live 
on the fatta the lan-an' rabbits?" 
 
 "I don' know," said George. "We gotta get a big stake together. I 
know a little place we can get cheap, but they ain't givin' it away."

--- Chunk 10 ---
with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at ’em because he ain’t a big 
guy. You seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?" 
 
 "Sure," said George. "I seen plenty tough little guys. But this 
Curley better not make no mistakes about Lennie. Lennie ain’t 
handy, but this Curley punk is gonna get' hurt if he messes

--- Chunk 11 ---
Carlson finished the cleaning of the gun and put it in the bag and 
pushed the bag under his bunk. "I guess I'll go out and look her 
over," he said. Old Candy lay still, and Lennie, from his bunk, 
watched George cautiously. 
 
 When Whit and Carlson were gone and the door closed after 
them, George turned to Lennie. "What you got on your mind?" 
 
 "I ain't done nothing, George. Slim says I better not pet them 
pups so much for a while. Slim says it ain't good for them; so I

--- Chunk 12 ---
ast George." 
 
 Crooks put his dark chin into his pink palm. "You travel aroun' 
with George, don't ya?" 
 
 "Sure. Me an' him goes ever' place together." 
 
 Crooks continued. "Sometimes he talks, and you don't know what 
the hell he's talkin' about. Ain't that so?" He leaned forward, 
boring Lennie with his deep eyes. "Ain't that so?" 
 
 "Yeah . . . . sometimes." 
 
 "Jus' talks on, an' you don't know what the hell it's all about?" 
 
 "Yeah . . . . sometimes. But . . . . not always."

wall. "You tol' me to, George," he said miserably. 
 
 Curley sat down on the floor, looking in wonder at his crushed 
hand. Slim and Carlson bent over him. Then Slim straightened up 
and regarded Lennie with horror. "We got to get him in to a 
doctor," he said. "Looks to me like ever' bone in his han' is bust." 
 
 "I didn't wanta," Lennie cried. "I didn't wanta hurt him." 
 
 Slim said, "Carlson, you get the candy wagon hitched up. We'll

--- Chunk 14 ---

that? So the guys won't think I was in on it?" 
 
 Candy said, "Sure, George. Sure I'll do that." 
 
 "O.K. Give me a couple minutes then, and you come runnin' out 
an' tell like you jus' found her. I'm going now." George turned and 
went quickly out of the barn. 
 
 Old Candy watched him go. He looked helplessly back at Curley's 
wife, and gradually his sorrow and his anger grew into words.

and play cards or shoot pool." Lennie knelt and looked over the 
fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s face was drawn with terror. 
"An’ whatta I got," George went on furiously. "I got you! You can’t 
keep a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me shovin’ all 
over the country all the time. An’ that ain’t the,' worst. You get in 
trouble. You do bad things and I got m get you out." His voice rose


=== Question 41 ===
What has happened to Lennie's puppy and why?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Lennie said, "Well, I ain't supposed to. George's scared I'll get in 
trouble." 
 
 She changed the subject. "What you got covered up there?" 
 
 Then all of Lennie's woe came back on him. "Joe my pup," he said 
sadly. "Jus' my little pup." And he swept the hay from on top of it. 
 
 "Why, he's dead," she cried. 
 
 "He was so little," said Lennie. "I was jus' playin' with him . . . . 
an' he made like he's gonna bite me . . . . an' I made like I was

outside. He crouched down in the hay and listened. "I done a real 
bad thing," he said. "I shouldn't of did that. George'll be mad. An' . 
. . . he said . . . . an' hide in the brush till he come. He's gonna be 
mad. In the brush till he come. Tha's what he said." Lennie went-
back and looked at the dead girl. The puppy lay close to her. 
Lennie picked it up. "I'll throw him away," he said. "It's bad 
enough like it is." He put the pup under his coat, and he crept to

--- Chunk 3 ---
where Lennie had been concealing it against his stomach. 
 
 Lennie sat up quickly. "Give 'um to me, George." 
 
 George said, "You get right up an' take this pup back to the nest. 
He's gotta sleep with his mother. You want to kill him? Just born 
last night an' you take him out of the nest. You take him back or 
I'll tell Slim not to let you have him." 
 
 Lennie held out his hands pleadingly. "Give 'um to me, George. 
I'll take 'um back. I didn't mean no harm, George. Honest I didn't.

--- Chunk 4 ---
Lennie twisted his neck and looked over his shoulder. "Huh? 
What you want, George?" 
 
 "I tol' you you couldn't bring that pup in here." 
 
 "What pup, George? I ain't got no pup." 
 
 George went quickly to him, grabbed him by the shoulder and 
rolled him over. He reached down and picked the tiny puppy from

listener could be taken away. "I lived right in Salinas," she said. 
"Come there when I was a kid. Well, a show come through, an' I 
met one of the actors. He says I could go with that show. But my of 
lady- wouldn' let me. She says because I was on'y fifteen. But the 
guy says I coulda. If I'd went, I wouldn't be livin' like this, you 
bet." 
 
 Lennie stroked the pup back and forth. "We gonna have a little 
place-an' rabbits," he explained.

--- Chunk 6 ---
George." 
 
 Curley's wife came around the end of the last stall. She came very 
quietly, so that Lennie didn't see her. She wore her bright cotton 
dress and the mules with the red ostrich feathers. Her face was 
made up and the little sausage curls were all in place. She was 
quite near to him before Lennie looked up and saw her. 
 
 In a panic he shoveled hay over the puppy with his fingers. He 
looked sullenly up at her.She said, "What you got there, sonny 
boy?"

--- Chunk 7 ---
some tar on it." His voice trailed off. It was silent outside. 
Carlson's footsteps died away. The silence come into the room. 
And the silence lasted. 
 
 George chuckled, "I bet Lennie's right out there in the barn with 
his pup. He won't want to come in here no more now he's got a 
pup." 
 
 Slim said, "Candy, you can have any one of them pups you want."

--- Chunk 8 ---
I'll take 'um back. I didn't mean no harm, George. Honest I didn't. 
I jus' wanted to pet 'um a little." 
 
 George handed the pup to him. "Awright. You get him back there 
quick, and don't you take him out no more. You'll kill him, the 
first thing you know." Lennie fairly scuttled out of the room. 
 
 Slim had not moved. His calm eyes followed Lennie out the door. 
"Jesus," he said. "He's jes' like kid, ain't he." 
 
 "Sure he's jes' like a kid. There ain't no more harm in him than a

streaks climbed up the wall and fell over the feeding racks and 
over the heads of the horses. 
 
 Lennie said, "Maybe if I took this pup out and throwed him away 
George wouldn't never know: An' then I could tend the rabbits 
without n 
 
 trouble." 
 
 Curley's wife said angrily, "Don't you think of nothing but 
rabbits?" 
 
 "We gonna have a little place," Lennie explained patiently. "We 
gonna have a house an' a garden and a place for alfalfa, an' that

looked sullenly up at her.She said, "What you got there, sonny 
boy?" 
 
 Lennie glared at her. "George says I ain't to have nothing to do 
with you-talk to you or nothing." 
 
 She laughed "George giving you orders about everything?" 
 
 Lennie looked down at the hay. "Says I can't tend no rabbits if I 
talk to you or anything." 
 
 She said quietly, "He's scared Curley'll get mad. Well, Curley got 
his arm in a sling-an' if Curley gets tough, you can break his other

pups so much for a while. Slim says it ain't good for them; so I 
come right in. I been good, George." 
 
 "I coulda told you that," said George. 
 
 "Well, I wasn't hurtin' 'em none. I jus' had mine in my lap pettin' 
it." 
 
 George asked, "Did you see Slim out in the barn?" 
 
 "Sure I did. He tol' me I better not pet that pup no more." 
 
 "Did you see that girl?" 
 
 "You mean Curley's girl?" 
 
 "Yeah. Did she come in the barn?" 
 
 "No. Anyways I never seen her."

--- Chunk 12 ---
he said quietly. "If you go right now, we won't tell Curley you was 
here." 
 
 She appraised him coolly. "I ain't sure you heard nothing." 
 
 "Better not take no chances," he said. "If you ain't sure, you better 
take the safe way." 
 
 She turned to Lennie. "I'm glad you bust up Curley a little bit. He 
got it comin' to him. Sometimes I'd like to bust him myself." She 
slipped out the door and disappeared into the dark barn. And

--- Chunk 13 ---
Carlson finished the cleaning of the gun and put it in the bag and 
pushed the bag under his bunk. "I guess I'll go out and look her 
over," he said. Old Candy lay still, and Lennie, from his bunk, 
watched George cautiously. 
 
 When Whit and Carlson were gone and the door closed after 
them, George turned to Lennie. "What you got on your mind?" 
 
 "I ain't done nothing, George. Slim says I better not pet them 
pups so much for a while. Slim says it ain't good for them; so I

Lennie was in a panic. His face was contorted. She screamed 
then, and Lennie's other hand closed over her mouth and nose. 
"Please don't," he begged. "Oh! Please don't do that. George'll be 
mad." 
 
 She struggled violently under his hands. Her feet battered on the 
hay and she writhed to be free; and from under Lennie's hand 
came a muffled screaming. Lennie began to cry with fright. "Oh! 
Please don't do none of that," he begged. "George gonna say I done

hesitated, and when he spoke again his voice was softer. "There 
wasn't another colored family for miles around. And now there 
ain't a colored man on this ranch an' there's jus' one family in 
Soledad." He laughed. "If I say something, why it's just a nigger 
sayin' it" 
 
 Lennie asked, "How long you think it'll be before them pups will 
be old enough to pet?" 
 
 Crooks laughed again. "A guy can talk to you an' be sure you


=== Question 42 ===
What two pieces of information does Curley's wife share with Lennie?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Curley's wife moved away from him a little. "I think you're nuts," 
she said. 
 
 "No I ain't," Lennie explained earnestly. "George says I ain't. I 
like to pet nice things with my fingers, sof' things. " 
 
 She was a little bit reassured. "Well, who don't?" she said. 
"Ever'body likes that. I like to feel silk an' velvet. Do you like to 
feel velvet?" 
 
 Lennie chuckled with pleasure. "You bet, by God," he cried 
happily. "An' I had some, too. A lady give me some, an' that lady

 Curley's wife came around the end of the last stall. She came very

--- Chunk 3 ---
"Me? Sure." 
 
 "Well, I ain't told this to nobody before. Maybe I ought'n to. I 
don'like Curley. He ain't a nice fella." And because she had 
confided in him, she moved closer to Lennie and sat beside him. 
"Coulda been in the movies, an' had nice clothes-all them nice

George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my

lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have

 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing

 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

 George looked around at Lennie. "Jesus, what a tramp," he said. 
"So that's what Curley picks for a wife." 
 
 "She's purty," said Lennie defensively. 
 
 "Yeah, and she's sure hidin' it. Curley got his work ahead of him. 
Bet she'd clear out for twenty bucks." 
 
 Lennie still stared at the doorway where she had been. "Gosh, she

 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

Curley's got yella-jackets in his drawers, but that's all so far. Ever'

she thought she lef' sotnethin' layin' around and she's lookin' for

 George said, "She's gonna make a mess. They's gonna be a bad

if I want to." 
 
 "Any you boys seen Curley?" 
 
 They swung their heads toward the door. Looking in was Curley's 
wife. Her face was heavily made up. Her lips were slightly parted. 
She breathed strongly, as though she had been running. 
 
 "Curley ain't been here," Candy said sourly. 
 
 She stood still in the doorway, smiling a little at them, rubbing 
the nails of one hand with the thumb and forefinger of the other.

 "Well, let him be handy," said George, "He don’t have to take after

Lennie?" 
 
 The swamper considered..... "Well.... tell you what. Curley’s like a

 She went on with her story quickly, before she should be 
interrupted. "'Nother time I met a guy, an' he was in pitchers. 
Went out to the Riverside Dance Palace with him. He says he was 
gonna put me in the movies. Says I was a natural. Soon's he got

 Curley sat down on the floor, looking in wonder at his crushed 
hand. Slim and Carlson bent over him. Then Slim straightened up 
and regarded Lennie with horror. "We got to get him in to a 
doctor," he said. "Looks to me like ever' bone in his han' is bust." 
 
 "I didn't wanta," Lennie cried. "I didn't wanta hurt him." 
 
 Slim said, "Carlson, you get the candy wagon hitched up. We'll

 When she didn't answer, he stepped nearer. "You oughten to sleep

in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

tried and tried." 
 
 She interrupted him. "All the time he coulda had such a good 
time if it wasn't for you. He woulda took his pay an' raised hell in 
a whore house, and he coulda set in a poolroom an' played 
snooker. But he got to take care of you." 
 
 Lennie moaned with grief. "I know, Aunt Clara, ma'am. I'll go 
right off in the hills an' I'll fin' a cave an' I'll live there so I won't 
be no more trouble to George."

--- Chunk 7 ---
terror. He shook her then, and he was angry with her. "Don't you 
go yellin'," he said, and he shook her; and her body flopped like a 
fish. And then she was still, for Lennie had broken her neck. 
 
 He looked down at her, and carefully be removed his hand from 
over her mouth, and she lay still. "I don't want to hurt you," he 
said, "but George'll be mad if you yell." When she didn't answer 
nor move he bent closely over her. He lifted her arm and let it

Curley came suddenly to life. "I know who done it," he cried. 
"That big son-of-a-bitch done it. I know he done it. Why-ever'body 
else was out there playin' horseshoes." He worked himself into a 
fury. "I'm gonna get him. I'm going for my shotgun. I'll kill the big 
son-of-a-bitch myself. I'll shoot 'im in the guts. Come on, you 
guys." He ran furiously out of the barn. Carlson said, "I'll get my 
Luger," and he ran out too.

--- Chunk 9 ---
looked sullenly up at her.She said, "What you got there, sonny 
boy?" 
 
 Lennie glared at her. "George says I ain't to have nothing to do 
with you-talk to you or nothing." 
 
 She laughed "George giving you orders about everything?" 
 
 Lennie looked down at the hay. "Says I can't tend no rabbits if I 
talk to you or anything." 
 
 She said quietly, "He's scared Curley'll get mad. Well, Curley got 
his arm in a sling-an' if Curley gets tough, you can break his other

wall. "You tol' me to, George," he said miserably. 
 
 Curley sat down on the floor, looking in wonder at his crushed 
hand. Slim and Carlson bent over him. Then Slim straightened up 
and regarded Lennie with horror. "We got to get him in to a 
doctor," he said. "Looks to me like ever' bone in his han' is bust." 
 
 "I didn't wanta," Lennie cried. "I didn't wanta hurt him." 
 
 Slim said, "Carlson, you get the candy wagon hitched up. We'll

--- Chunk 11 ---
Slim said, "Well, you been askin' me too often. I'm gettin' God 
damn sick of it. If you can't look after your own God damn wife, 
what you expect me to do about it? You lay offa me." 
 
 "I'm jus' tryin' to tell you I didn't mean nothing," said Curley. "I 
jus' thought you might of saw her." 
 
 "Why'n't you tell her to stay the hell home where she belongs?" 
said Carlson. "You let her hang around bunk houses and pretty 
soon you're gonna have som'pin on your hands and you won't be

--- Chunk 12 ---
George." 
 
 Curley's wife came around the end of the last stall. She came very 
quietly, so that Lennie didn't see her. She wore her bright cotton 
dress and the mules with the red ostrich feathers. Her face was 
made up and the little sausage curls were all in place. She was 
quite near to him before Lennie looked up and saw her. 
 
 In a panic he shoveled hay over the puppy with his fingers. He 
looked sullenly up at her.She said, "What you got there, sonny 
boy?"

--- Chunk 13 ---
But Candy said excitedly, "We oughtta let'im get away. You don't 
know that Curley. Curley gon'ta wanta get 'im lynched. Curley'll 
get 'im killed." 
 
 George watched Candy's lips. "Yeah," he said at last, "that's right, 
Curley will. An' the other guys will." And he looked back at 
Curley's wife. 
 
 Now Candy spoke his greatest fear. "You an' me can get that little 
place, can't we, George? You an' me can go there an' live nice, can't 
we, George? Can't we?"

--- Chunk 14 ---
around the end of the last stall. "Oh, Lennie!" he called again; and 
then he stopped, and his body stiffened. He rubbed his smooth 
wrist on his white stubble whiskers. "I di'n't know you was here," 
he said to Curley's wife. 
 
 When she didn't answer, he stepped nearer. "You oughten to sleep 
out here," he said disapprovingly; and then he was beside her and-
"Oh, Jesus Christ!" He looked about helplessly, and he rubbed his 
beard. And then he jumped up and went quickly out of the barn.

--- Chunk 15 ---
"Me? Sure." 
 
 "Well, I ain't told this to nobody before. Maybe I ought'n to. I 
don'like Curley. He ain't a nice fella." And because she had 
confided in him, she moved closer to Lennie and sat beside him. 
"Coulda been in the movies, an' had nice clothes-all them nice


=== Question 45 ===
Why does George say that they can't let Lennie escape to live on his own?

--- Chunk 1 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 2 ---
Maybe you wouldn’t killit. That’d be better than. mice. And you 
could pet it harder." 
 
 Lennie avoided the bait. He had sensed his advantage, "If you 
don’t want me, you only jus’ got to say so, and I’ll go off in those 
hills right there - right up in those hills and live by myself. An’ I 
won’t get no mice stole from me." 
 
 George said, "I want you to stay with me, Lennie. Jesus Christ, 
somebody’d shoot you for a coyote if you was by yourself. No, you

--- Chunk 3 ---
"He won't do it," Lennie cried. "George wouldn't do nothing like 
that. I been with George a long time. He'll come back tonight-" But 
the doubt was too much for him. "Don't you think he will?" 
 
 Crooks' face lighted with pleasure in his torture. 
 
 "Nobody can't tell what a guy'll do," he observed calmly. "Le's say 
he wants to come back and can't. S'pose he gets killed or hurt so 
he can't come back." 
 
 Lennie struggled to understand. "George won't do nothing like

--- Chunk 4 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

--- Chunk 5 ---
every damn month. Get a gallon of whisky, or set in a pool room 
and play cards or shoot pool." Lennie knelt and looked over the 
fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s face was drawn with terror. 
"An’ whatta I got," George went on furiously. "I got you! You can’t 
keep a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me shovin’ all 
over the country all the time. An’ that ain’t the,' worst. You get in 
trouble. You do bad things and I got m get you out." His voice rose

--- Chunk 6 ---
'He better not fool with Lennie if he knows what's good for 'um.' 
That's jus' what you says to me." 
 
 George turned to Lennie. "It ain't your fault," he said. "You don't 
need to be scairt no more. You done jus' what I tol' you to. Maybe 
you better go in the ' wash room an' clean up your face. You look 
like' hell." 
 
 Lennie smiled with his bruised mouth. "I didn't want no trouble," 
he said. He walked toward the door, but just before he came to it, 
he turned back. "George?"

--- Chunk 7 ---
tried and tried." 
 
 She interrupted him. "All the time he coulda had such a good 
time if it wasn't for you. He woulda took his pay an' raised hell in 
a whore house, and he coulda set in a poolroom an' played 
snooker. But he got to take care of you." 
 
 Lennie moaned with grief. "I know, Aunt Clara, ma'am. I'll go 
right off in the hills an' I'll fin' a cave an' I'll live there so I won't 
be no more trouble to George."

--- Chunk 8 ---
"I never meant no harm, George. Honest I never." 
 
 "Well, you keep away from her, 'cause she's a rattrap if I ever 
seen one. You let Curley take the rap. He let himself in for it. 
Glove fulla vaseline," George said disgustedly. "An' I bet he's eatin' 
raw eggs and writin' to the patent medicine houses." 
 
 Lennie cried out suddenly-"I don' like this place, George. This 
ain't no good place. I wanna get outa here." 
 
 "We gotta keep it till we get a stake. We can't help it, Lennie.

--- Chunk 9 ---
where Lennie had been concealing it against his stomach. 
 
 Lennie sat up quickly. "Give 'um to me, George." 
 
 George said, "You get right up an' take this pup back to the nest. 
He's gotta sleep with his mother. You want to kill him? Just born 
last night an' you take him out of the nest. You take him back or 
I'll tell Slim not to let you have him." 
 
 Lennie held out his hands pleadingly. "Give 'um to me, George. 
I'll take 'um back. I didn't mean no harm, George. Honest I didn't.

--- Chunk 10 ---
"The hell you wouldn'," said the rabbit. "You ain't worth a greased 
jack-pin to ram you into hell. Christ knows George done ever'thing 
he could to jack you outa the sewer, but it don't do no good. If you 
think George gonna let you tend rabbits, you're even crazier'n 
usual. He ain't. He's gonna bear hell outa you with a stick, that's 
what he's gonna do." 
 
 Now Lennie retorted belligerently, "He ain't neither. George won't

--- Chunk 11 ---
"An' when the end of the month come I could take my fifty bucks 
an' go to a . . . . cat house. . . ." He stopped again. 
 
 Lennie looked eagerly at him. "Go on, George. Ain't you gonna 
give me no more hell?" 
 
 "No," said George. 
 
 "Well, I can go away," said Lennie. "I'll go right off in the hills an' 
find a cave if you don' want me." 
 
 George shook himself again. "No," he said. "I want you to stay 
with me here." 
 
 Lennie said craftily- "Tell me like you done before."

--- Chunk 12 ---
what he's gonna do." 
 
 Now Lennie retorted belligerently, "He ain't neither. George won't 
do nothing like that. I've knew George since-1 forget when-and he 
ain't never raised his ban' to me with a stick. He's nice to me. He 
ain't gonna be mean." 
 
 "Well, he's sick of you," said the rabbit. "He's gonna beat hell outa 
you an' then go away an' leave you." 
 
 "He won't," Lennie cried frantically. "He won't do nothing like 
that. I know George. Me an' him travels together."

--- Chunk 13 ---
into Lennie's brain. 
 
 George said quietly, "What the hell you yellin' about?" 
 
 Lennie got up on his knees. "You ain't gonna leave me, are ya, 
George? I know you ain't." 
 
 George came stiffly near and sat down beside him. 
 
 "No." 
 
 "I knowed it," Lennie cried. "You ain't that kind." 
 
 George was silent. 
 
 Lennie said, "George." 
 
 "Yeah ?" 
 
 "I done another bad thing." 
 
 "It don't make no difference," George said, and he fell silent 
again.

--- Chunk 14 ---
with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at ’em because he ain’t a big 
guy. You seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?" 
 
 "Sure," said George. "I seen plenty tough little guys. But this 
Curley better not make no mistakes about Lennie. Lennie ain’t 
handy, but this Curley punk is gonna get' hurt if he messes

--- Chunk 15 ---
ask him." 
 
 "A brown and white one," Lennie cried excitedly. 
 
 "Come on. Le's get dinner. I don't know whether he got a brown 
and white one." 
 
 Lennie didn't move from his bunk. "You ask him right away, 
George, so he won't kill no more of em." 
 
 "Sure. Come on now, get up on your feet." 
 
 Lennie rolled off his bunk and stood up, and the two of them 
started for the door. Just as they reached it, Curley bounced in. 
 
 "You seen a girl around here?" he demanded angrily.


=== Question 46 ===
What is Candy's greatest fear?

--- Chunk 1 ---
But Candy said excitedly, "We oughtta let'im get away. You don't 
know that Curley. Curley gon'ta wanta get 'im lynched. Curley'll 
get 'im killed." 
 
 George watched Candy's lips. "Yeah," he said at last, "that's right, 
Curley will. An' the other guys will." And he looked back at 
Curley's wife. 
 
 Now Candy spoke his greatest fear. "You an' me can get that little 
place, can't we, George? You an' me can go there an' live nice, can't 
we, George? Can't we?"

--- Chunk 2 ---
against her. And she looked longest at Lennie, until he dropped 
his eyes in embarrassment. Suddenly she said, "Where'd you get 
them bruises on your face?" 
 
 Lennie looked up guiltily. "Who-me?" 
 
 "Yeah, you." 
 
 Lennie looked to Candy for help, and then he looked at his lap 
again. "He got his han' caught in a machine," he said. 
 
 Curley's wife laughed. "O.K., Machine. I'll talk to you later. I like 
machines." 
 
 Candy broke in. "You let this guy alone. Don't you do no messing

--- Chunk 3 ---
She turned at last to the other two. 
 
 Old Candy was watching her, fascinated. "If you was to do that, 
we'd tell," he said quietly. "We'd tell about you framin' Crooks." 
 
 "Tell an' be damned," she cried. "Nobody'd listen to you, an' you 
know it. Nobody'd listen to you." 
 
 Candy subsided. "No ..." he agreed. "Nobody'd listen to us." 
 
 Lennie whined, "I wisht George was here. I wisht George was 
here." 
 
 Candy stepped over to him. "Don't you worry none," he said. "I

--- Chunk 4 ---
Now Candy aroused himself. "Oh, George! I been figurin' and 
figurin'. I got it doped out how we can even make some money on 
them rabbits." 
 
 George scowled. "I thought I tol' you not to tell nobody about 
that." 
 
 Candy was crestfallen. "Didn't tell nobody but Crooks." 
 
 George said, "Well you guys get outta here. Jesus, seems like I 
can't go away for a minute." 
 
 Candy and Lennie stood up and went toward the door. Crooks 
called, "Candy!" 
 
 "Huh?"

--- Chunk 5 ---
matter with her?" he asked. He stepped closer, and then he echoed 
Candy's words. "Oh, Jesus Christ!" He was down on his knees 
beside her.He put his hand over her heart. And finally, when he 
stood up, slowly and stify, his face was as hard and tight as wood, 
and his eyes were hard. 
 
 Candy said, "What done it?" 
 
 George looked coldly at him. "Ain't you got any idear?" he asked. 
And Candy was silent. "I should of knew," George said hopelessly. 
"I guess maybe way back in my head I did."

--- Chunk 6 ---
Lennie watched her, fascinated; but Candy and Crooks were 
scowling down away from her eyes. Candy said, "Then if you 
know, why you want to ast us where Curley is at?" 
 
 She regarded them amusedly. "Funny thing," she said. "If I catch 
any one man, and he's alone, I get along fine with him. But just let 
two of the guys get together an' you won't talk. Jus' nothing but 
mad" She dropped her fingers and put her hands on her hips.

--- Chunk 7 ---
Candy did not answer. The silence fell on the room again. It came 
out of the night and invaded the room. George said, "Anybody like 
to play a little euchre?" 
 
 "I'll play out a few with you," said Whit. 
 
 They took places opposite each other at the table under the light, 
but George did not shuffle the cards. He rippled the edge of the 
deck nervously, and the little snapping noise drew.the eyes of all 
the men in the room, so that he stopped doing it. The silence fell

--- Chunk 8 ---
"I guess maybe way back in my head I did." 
 
 Candy asked, "What we gonna do now, George? What we gonna 
do now?" 
 
 George was a long time in answering. "Guess . . . . we gotta tell 
the . . . . guys. I guess we gotta get 'im an' lock 'im up. We can't let 
'im get away. Why, the poor bastard'd starve." And he tried to 
reassure himself. "Maybe they'll lock 'im up an' be nice to In."

--- Chunk 9 ---
you're the best welter in the country. You come for me, an' I'll kick 
your God damn head off." 
 
 Candy joined the attack with joy. "Glove fulla vaseline," he said 
disgustedly. Curley glared at him. His eyes slipped on past and

--- Chunk 10 ---
During the conversation Carlson had refused to be drawn in. He 
continued to look down at the old dog. Candy watched him 
uneasily. At last Carlson said, "if you want me to, I'll put the old 
devil out of his misery right now and get it over with. Ain't 
nothing left for him. Can't eat, can't see, can't even walk without 
hurtin'." 
 
 Candy said hopefully, "You ain't got no gun." 
 
 "The hell I ain't. Got a Luger. It won't hurt him none at all."

--- Chunk 11 ---
Only Candy continued to stare at the ceiling. 
 
 "Sounds like there was a rat under there," said Geoge. "We ought 
to get a trap down there." 
 
 Whit broke out, "What the hell's takin' him so long? Lay out some 
cards, why don't you? We ain't going to get no euchre played this 
way." 
 
 George brought the cards together tightly and studied the backs 
of them. The silence was in the room again. 
 
 A shot sounded in the distance. The men looked quickly at the old

--- Chunk 12 ---
Candy quickly changed the subject. "Slim's as good a skinner as I 
ever seen." 
 
 Lennie leaned toward the old swamper "About them rabbits," he 
insisted. 
 
 Candy smiled. "I got it figured out. We can make some money on 
them rabbits if we go about it right." 
 
 "But I get to tend'em," Lennie broke in. "George says I get to tend 
'em. He promised." 
 
 Crooks interrupted brutally. "You guys is just kiddin' yourself.

--- Chunk 13 ---
Candy looked a long time at Slim to try to find some reversal. And 
Slim gave him none. At last Candy said softly and hopelessly, 
"Awright--take 'im." He did not look down at the dog at all. He lay 
back on his bunk and crossed his arms behind his head and stared

--- Chunk 14 ---
gonna get 'im." 
 
 Slim turned to Candy. "You stay here with her then, Candy. The 
rest of us better get goin'." 
 
 They moved away. George stopped a moment beside Candy and 
they both looked down at the dead girl until Curley called, "You 
George! You stick with us so we don't think you had nothin' to do 
with this."

--- Chunk 15 ---
and I'll come along and make like I never seen her. Will you do 
that? So the guys won't think I was in on it?" 
 
 Candy said, "Sure, George. Sure I'll do that." 
 
 "O.K. Give me a couple minutes then, and you come runnin' out 
an' tell like you jus' found her. I'm going now." George turned and 
went quickly out of the barn. 
 
 Old Candy watched him go. He looked helplessly back at Curley's 
wife, and gradually his sorrow and his anger grew into words.


=== Question 47 ===
When George asks Slim about just trying to catch Lennie instead of killing him, what advice does Slim give George?

--- Chunk 1 ---
no fun. After a long time they get mean. They get wantin' to fight 
all the time. 
 
 "Yeah, they get mean," Slim agreed. "They get so they don't want 
to talk to nobody." 
 
 "'Course Lennie's a God damn nuisance most of the time," said 
George. "But you get used to goin' around with a guy an' you can't 
get rid of him." 
 
 "He ain't mean," said Slim. "I can see Lennie ain't a bit mean." 
 
 "'Course he ain't mean. But he gets in trouble alla time because

--- Chunk 2 ---
Slim came directly to George and sat down beside him, sat very 
close to him. "Never you mind," said Slim. "A guy got to 
sometimes." 
 
 But Carlson was standing over George. "How'd you do it?" he 
asked. 
 
 "I just done it," George said tiredly. 
 
 "Did he have my gun?" 
 
 "Yeah. He had your gun." 
 
 "An' you got it away from him and you took it an' you killed him?" 
 
 "Yeah. Tha's how." George's voice was almost a whisper. He

--- Chunk 3 ---
guys." He ran furiously out of the barn. Carlson said, "I'll get my 
Luger," and he ran out too. 
 
 Slim turned quietly to George. "I guess Lennie done it, all right," 
he said. "Her neck's bust. Lennie coulda did that." 
 
 George didn't answer, but he nodded slowly. His hat was so far 
down on his forehead that his eyes were covered. 
 
 Slim went on, "Maybe like that time in Weed you was tellin' 
about." 
 
 Again George nodded.

--- Chunk 4 ---
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George." 
 
 George got up and went over to Lennie's bunk and sat down on it. 
"I hate that kinda bastard," he said. "I seen plenty of 'em. Like the 
old guy says, Curley don't take no chances. He always wins." He 
thought for a moment. "If he tangles with you, Lennie, we're 
gonna get the can. Don't make no mistake about that. He's the 
boss's son. Look, Lennie. You try to keep away from him, will you?

--- Chunk 5 ---
"Curley's just spoilin' or he wouldn't start for Slim. An' Curley's 
handy, God damn handy. Got in the finals for the Golden Gloves. 
He got newspaper clippings about it." He considered. "But jus' the 
same, he better leave Slim alone. Nobody don't know what Slim 
can do." 
 
 "Thinks Slim's with his wife, don't he?" said George. 
 
 "Looks like it," Whit said. "'Course Slim ain't. Least I don't think 
Slim is. But I like to see the fuss if it comes off. Come on, le's go."

--- Chunk 6 ---
Maybe you wouldn’t killit. That’d be better than. mice. And you 
could pet it harder." 
 
 Lennie avoided the bait. He had sensed his advantage, "If you 
don’t want me, you only jus’ got to say so, and I’ll go off in those 
hills right there - right up in those hills and live by myself. An’ I 
won’t get no mice stole from me." 
 
 George said, "I want you to stay with me, Lennie. Jesus Christ, 
somebody’d shoot you for a coyote if you was by yourself. No, you

--- Chunk 7 ---
Lennie's hands remained at his sides; he was too frightened to 
defend himself. 
 
 George was on his feet yelling, "Get him, Lennie. Don't let him do 
it." 
 
 Lennie covered his face with his huge paws and bleated with 
terror. He cried, "Make 'um stop, George." Then Curley attacked 
his stomach and cut off his wind. 
 
 Slim jumped up. "The dirty little rat," he cried, "I'll get 'um 
myself." 
 
 George put out his hand and grabbed Slim. "Wait a minute," he

--- Chunk 8 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

--- Chunk 9 ---
Lennie, who had been following the conversation back and forth 
with his eyes, smiled complacency at the compliment. Slim looked 
approvingly at George for having given the compliment. He leaned 
over the table and snapped the corner of a loose card. "You guys 
travel around together?" His tone was friendly. It invited 
confidence without demanding it. 
 
 "Sure," said George. "We kinda look after each other." He 
indicated Lennie with his thumb. "He ain't bright. Hell of a good

--- Chunk 10 ---
"Don't tell nobody," Lennie said to himself. 
 
 Candy said, "George." 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "I ought to of shot that dog myself, George. I shouldn't ought to of 
let no stranger shoot my dog." 
 
 The door opened. Slim came in, followed by Curley and Carlson 
and Whit. Slim's hands were black with tar and he was scowling. 
Curley hung close to his elbow. 
 
 Curley said, "Well, I didn't mean nothing, Slim. I just ast you." 
 
 Slim said, "Well, you been askin' me too often. I'm gettin' God

--- Chunk 11 ---
Slim is. But I like to see the fuss if it comes off. Come on, le's go." 
 
 George said, "I'm stayin' right here. I don't want to get mixed up 
in nothing. Lennie and me got to make a stake."

--- Chunk 12 ---
with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at ’em because he ain’t a big 
guy. You seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?" 
 
 "Sure," said George. "I seen plenty tough little guys. But this 
Curley better not make no mistakes about Lennie. Lennie ain’t 
handy, but this Curley punk is gonna get' hurt if he messes

--- Chunk 13 ---
George stepped close. "Couldn' we maybe bring him in an' they'll 
lock him up? He's nuts, Slim. He never done this to be mean." 
 
 Slim nodded. "We might," he said. "If we could keep Curley in, we 
might. But Curley's gonna want to shoot 'im. Curley's still mad 
about his hand. An' s'pose they lock him up an' strap him down 
and put him in a cage. That ain't no good, George." 
 
 "I know," said George. "I know."

--- Chunk 14 ---
indicated Lennie with his thumb. "He ain't bright. Hell of a good 
worker, though. Hell of a nice fella, but he ain't bright. I've knew 
him for a long time." 
 
 Slim looked through George and beyond him. "Ain't many guys 
travel around together," he mused. "I don't know why. Maybe 
ever'body in the whole damn world is scared of each other." 
 
 "It's a lot nicer to go around with a guy you know," said George. 
 
 A powerful, big-stomached man came into the bunk house. His

Slim says I ain't to pet 'em very much." 
 
 Crooks said, "Well, you been takin' 'em out of the nest all the 
time. I wonder the old lady don't move 'em someplace else." 
 
 "Oh, she don't care. She lets me." Lennie had moved into the room 
again. 
 
 Crooks scowled, but Lennie's disarming smile defeated him. 
"Come on in and set a while," Crooks said. "'Long as you won't get 
out and leave me alone, you might as well set down." His tone was


=== Question 48 ===
What makes the men think that Lennie is armed?

--- Chunk 1 ---
But George sat stify on the bank and looked at his right hand 
that had thrown the gun away. The group burst into the clearing, 
and Curley was ahead. He saw Lennie lying on the sand. "Got 
him, by God." He went over and looked down at Lennie, and then 
he looked back at George. "Right in the back of the head," he said 
softly.

--- Chunk 2 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

--- Chunk 3 ---
with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at ’em because he ain’t a big 
guy. You seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?" 
 
 "Sure," said George. "I seen plenty tough little guys. But this 
Curley better not make no mistakes about Lennie. Lennie ain’t 
handy, but this Curley punk is gonna get' hurt if he messes

--- Chunk 4 ---
together and turned around to Lennie. Lennie was lying down on 
the bunk watching him. 
 
 "Look, Lennie! This here ain't no set up. I'm scared. You gonna 
have trouble with that Curley guy. I seen that kind before. He was 
kinda feelin' you out. He figures he's got you scared and he's 
gonna take a sock at you the first chance he gets." 
 
 Lennie's eyes were frightened. "I don't want no trouble," he said 
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George."

--- Chunk 5 ---
no fun. After a long time they get mean. They get wantin' to fight 
all the time. 
 
 "Yeah, they get mean," Slim agreed. "They get so they don't want 
to talk to nobody." 
 
 "'Course Lennie's a God damn nuisance most of the time," said 
George. "But you get used to goin' around with a guy an' you can't 
get rid of him." 
 
 "He ain't mean," said Slim. "I can see Lennie ain't a bit mean." 
 
 "'Course he ain't mean. But he gets in trouble alla time because

--- Chunk 6 ---
was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so 
you can almost see it." 
 
 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the 
darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," 
George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of 
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined.

--- Chunk 7 ---
he asked finally. 
 
 "Hell, no. He just scared her. I'd be scared too if he grabbed me. 
But he never hurt her. He jus' wanted to touch that red dress, like 
he wants to pet them pups all the time." 
 
 "He ain't mean," said Slim. "I can tell a mean guy a mile off." 
 
 "'Course he ain't, and he'll do any damn thing I-" 
 
 Lennie came in through the door. He wore his blue denim coat 
over his shoulders like a cape, and he walked hunched way over.

--- Chunk 8 ---
pretty handy. He done quite a bit in the ring. He’s a lightweight, 
and he’s handy." 
 
 "Well, let him be handy," said George, "He don’t have to take after 
Lennie. Lennie didn’t do nothing to him. What’s he got against 
Lennie?" 
 
 The swamper considered..... "Well.... tell you what. Curley’s like a 
lot of little guys. He hates big guys. He’s alla time picking scraps 
with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at ’em because he ain’t a big

--- Chunk 9 ---
"Gonna do it soon." 
 
 "Me an' you." 
 
 "You . . . . an' me. Ever'body gonna be nice to you. Ain't gonna be 
no more trouble. Nobody gon-na hurt nobody nor steal from 'em." 
 
 Lennie said, "I thought you was mad at me, George." 
 
 "No," said George. "No, Lennie. I ain't mad. I never been mad, an' 
I ain't now. That's a thing I want ya to know." 
 
 The voices came close now. George raised the gun and listened to 
the voices.

--- Chunk 10 ---
"He won't do it," Lennie cried. "George wouldn't do nothing like 
that. I been with George a long time. He'll come back tonight-" But 
the doubt was too much for him. "Don't you think he will?" 
 
 Crooks' face lighted with pleasure in his torture. 
 
 "Nobody can't tell what a guy'll do," he observed calmly. "Le's say 
he wants to come back and can't. S'pose he gets killed or hurt so 
he can't come back." 
 
 Lennie struggled to understand. "George won't do nothing like

--- Chunk 11 ---
guys." He ran furiously out of the barn. Carlson said, "I'll get my 
Luger," and he ran out too. 
 
 Slim turned quietly to George. "I guess Lennie done it, all right," 
he said. "Her neck's bust. Lennie coulda did that." 
 
 George didn't answer, but he nodded slowly. His hat was so far 
down on his forehead that his eyes were covered. 
 
 Slim went on, "Maybe like that time in Weed you was tellin' 
about." 
 
 Again George nodded.

--- Chunk 12 ---
Lennie, who had been following the conversation back and forth 
with his eyes, smiled complacency at the compliment. Slim looked 
approvingly at George for having given the compliment. He leaned 
over the table and snapped the corner of a loose card. "You guys 
travel around together?" His tone was friendly. It invited 
confidence without demanding it. 
 
 "Sure," said George. "We kinda look after each other." He 
indicated Lennie with his thumb. "He ain't bright. Hell of a good

--- Chunk 13 ---
answered. 
 
  "Go on," said Lennie. 
 
 George raised the gun and his hands shook, and he dropped his 
hand to the ground again. 
 
 "Go on," said Lennie. "How's it gonna be. We gonna get a little 
place." 
 
 "We'll have a cow," said George. "An' we'll have maybe a pig an' 
chickens . . . . an' down the flat we'll have a . . . . little piece alfalfa-
" 
 
 "For the rabbits," Lennie shouted. 
 
 "For the rabbits," George repeated. 
 
 "And I get to tend the rabbits."

--- Chunk 14 ---
said. "A guy can go in an' get drunk and get ever'thing outa his 
system all at once, an' no messes. And he knows how much it's 
gonna set him back. These here jail baits is just set on the trigger 
of the hoosegow." 
 
 Lennie followed his words admiringly, and moved his lips a little 
to keep up. George continued, "You remember Andy Cushman, 
Lennie? Went to grammar school?" 
 
 "The one that his old lady used to make hot cakes for the kids?" 
Lennie asked.

--- Chunk 15 ---
The voices came close now. George raised the gun and listened to 
the voices. 
 
 Lennie begged, "Le's do it now. Le's get that place now." 
 
 "Sure, right now. I gotta. We gotta." 
 
 And George raised the gun and steadied it, and he brought the 
muzzle of it close to the back of Lennie's head. The hand shook 
violently, but his face set and his hand steadied. He pulled the 
trigger. The crash of the shot rolled up the hills and rolled down


=== Question 49 ===
Where does Curley plan to aim if he shoots Lennie?

with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at ’em because he ain’t a big 
guy. You seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?" 
 
 "Sure," said George. "I seen plenty tough little guys. But this 
Curley better not make no mistakes about Lennie. Lennie ain’t

But George sat stify on the bank and looked at his right hand 
that had thrown the gun away. The group burst into the clearing, 
and Curley was ahead. He saw Lennie lying on the sand. "Got 
him, by God." He went over and looked down at Lennie, and then 
he looked back at George. "Right in the back of the head," he said 
softly.

pretty handy. He done quite a bit in the ring. He’s a lightweight, 
and he’s handy." 
 
 "Well, let him be handy," said George, "He don’t have to take after 
Lennie. Lennie didn’t do nothing to him. What’s he got against 
Lennie?" 
 
 The swamper considered..... "Well.... tell you what. Curley’s like a 
lot of little guys. He hates big guys. He’s alla time picking scraps

--- Chunk 4 ---
Curley came suddenly to life. "I know who done it," he cried. 
"That big son-of-a-bitch done it. I know he done it. Why-ever'body 
else was out there playin' horseshoes." He worked himself into a 
fury. "I'm gonna get him. I'm going for my shotgun. I'll kill the big 
son-of-a-bitch myself. I'll shoot 'im in the guts. Come on, you 
guys." He ran furiously out of the barn. Carlson said, "I'll get my 
Luger," and he ran out too.

--- Chunk 5 ---
we'll shoot 'im. " 
 
 George said weakly, "Maybe Carlson lost his gun.,, 
 
 "I seen it this morning," said Carlson. "No, it's been took." 
 
 Slim stood looking down at Curley's wife. He said, "Curley-maybe 
you better stay here with your wife." 
 
 Curley's face reddened. "I'm goin'," he said. "I'm gonna shoot the 
guts outa that big bastard myself, even if I only got one hand. I'm 
gonna get 'im." 
 
 Slim turned to Candy. "You stay here with her then, Candy. The

--- Chunk 6 ---
Maybe you wouldn’t killit. That’d be better than. mice. And you 
could pet it harder." 
 
 Lennie avoided the bait. He had sensed his advantage, "If you 
don’t want me, you only jus’ got to say so, and I’ll go off in those 
hills right there - right up in those hills and live by myself. An’ I 
won’t get no mice stole from me." 
 
 George said, "I want you to stay with me, Lennie. Jesus Christ, 
somebody’d shoot you for a coyote if you was by yourself. No, you

--- Chunk 7 ---
he said quietly. "If you go right now, we won't tell Curley you was 
here." 
 
 She appraised him coolly. "I ain't sure you heard nothing." 
 
 "Better not take no chances," he said. "If you ain't sure, you better 
take the safe way." 
 
 She turned to Lennie. "I'm glad you bust up Curley a little bit. He 
got it comin' to him. Sometimes I'd like to bust him myself." She 
slipped out the door and disappeared into the dark barn. And

--- Chunk 8 ---
Curley said, "You go in Soledad an' get a cop. Get AI Wilts, he's 
deputy sheriff. Le's go now." He turned suspiciously on George. 
"You're comin' with us, fella." 
 
 "Yeah," said George. "I'll come. But listen, Curley. The poor 
bastard's nuts. Don't shoot 'im. He di'n't know what he was doin'." 
 
 "Don't shoot 'im?" Curley cried. "He got Carlson's Luger. 'Course 
we'll shoot 'im. " 
 
 George said weakly, "Maybe Carlson lost his gun.,,

--- Chunk 9 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him

said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen.

together and turned around to Lennie. Lennie was lying down on 
the bunk watching him. 
 
 "Look, Lennie! This here ain't no set up. I'm scared. You gonna 
have trouble with that Curley guy. I seen that kind before. He was 
kinda feelin' you out. He figures he's got you scared and he's 
gonna take a sock at you the first chance he gets." 
 
 Lennie's eyes were frightened. "I don't want no trouble," he said 
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George."

--- Chunk 11 ---
George stepped close. "Couldn' we maybe bring him in an' they'll 
lock him up? He's nuts, Slim. He never done this to be mean." 
 
 Slim nodded. "We might," he said. "If we could keep Curley in, we 
might. But Curley's gonna want to shoot 'im. Curley's still mad 
about his hand. An' s'pose they lock him up an' strap him down 
and put him in a cage. That ain't no good, George." 
 
 "I know," said George. "I know."

answered. 
 
  "Go on," said Lennie. 
 
 George raised the gun and his hands shook, and he dropped his 
hand to the ground again.

 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the 
darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," 
George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of 
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined.

--- Chunk 14 ---
"Don't tell nobody," Lennie said to himself. 
 
 Candy said, "George." 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "I ought to of shot that dog myself, George. I shouldn't ought to of 
let no stranger shoot my dog." 
 
 The door opened. Slim came in, followed by Curley and Carlson 
and Whit. Slim's hands were black with tar and he was scowling. 
Curley hung close to his elbow. 
 
 Curley said, "Well, I didn't mean nothing, Slim. I just ast you." 
 
 Slim said, "Well, you been askin' me too often. I'm gettin' God

--- Chunk 15 ---
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George." 
 
 George got up and went over to Lennie's bunk and sat down on it. 
"I hate that kinda bastard," he said. "I seen plenty of 'em. Like the 
old guy says, Curley don't take no chances. He always wins." He 
thought for a moment. "If he tangles with you, Lennie, we're 
gonna get the can. Don't make no mistake about that. He's the 
boss's son. Look, Lennie. You try to keep away from him, will you?

Who stays with Curley's wife as the others go off in pursuit of Lennie?

bunk house, and she hurried away. 
 
 George looked around at Lennie. "Jesus, what a tramp," he said. 
"So that's what Curley picks for a wife." 
 
 "She's purty," said Lennie defensively. 
 
 "Yeah, and she's sure hidin' it. Curley got his work ahead of him. 
Bet she'd clear out for twenty bucks." 
 
 Lennie still stared at the doorway where she had been. "Gosh, she 
was purty." He smiled admiringly. George looked quickly down at 
him and then he took him by an ear and shook him.

--- Chunk 2 ---
Curley's wife moved away from him a little. "I think you're nuts," 
she said. 
 
 "No I ain't," Lennie explained earnestly. "George says I ain't. I 
like to pet nice things with my fingers, sof' things. " 
 
 She was a little bit reassured. "Well, who don't?" she said. 
"Ever'body likes that. I like to feel silk an' velvet. Do you like to 
feel velvet?" 
 
 Lennie chuckled with pleasure. "You bet, by God," he cried 
happily. "An' I had some, too. A lady give me some, an' that lady

--- Chunk 3 ---
he said quietly. "If you go right now, we won't tell Curley you was 
here." 
 
 She appraised him coolly. "I ain't sure you heard nothing." 
 
 "Better not take no chances," he said. "If you ain't sure, you better 
take the safe way." 
 
 She turned to Lennie. "I'm glad you bust up Curley a little bit. He 
got it comin' to him. Sometimes I'd like to bust him myself." She 
slipped out the door and disappeared into the dark barn. And

--- Chunk 4 ---
Slim said, "Well, you been askin' me too often. I'm gettin' God 
damn sick of it. If you can't look after your own God damn wife, 
what you expect me to do about it? You lay offa me." 
 
 "I'm jus' tryin' to tell you I didn't mean nothing," said Curley. "I 
jus' thought you might of saw her." 
 
 "Why'n't you tell her to stay the hell home where she belongs?" 
said Carlson. "You let her hang around bunk houses and pretty 
soon you're gonna have som'pin on your hands and you won't be

--- Chunk 5 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him

said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

--- Chunk 6 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 7 ---
around the end of the last stall. "Oh, Lennie!" he called again; and 
then he stopped, and his body stiffened. He rubbed his smooth 
wrist on his white stubble whiskers. "I di'n't know you was here," 
he said to Curley's wife. 
 
 When she didn't answer, he stepped nearer. "You oughten to sleep 
out here," he said disapprovingly; and then he was beside her and-
"Oh, Jesus Christ!" He looked about helplessly, and he rubbed his 
beard. And then he jumped up and went quickly out of the barn.

--- Chunk 8 ---
George." 
 
 Curley's wife came around the end of the last stall. She came very 
quietly, so that Lennie didn't see her. She wore her bright cotton 
dress and the mules with the red ostrich feathers. Her face was 
made up and the little sausage curls were all in place. She was 
quite near to him before Lennie looked up and saw her. 
 
 In a panic he shoveled hay over the puppy with his fingers. He 
looked sullenly up at her.She said, "What you got there, sonny 
boy?"

--- Chunk 9 ---
Curley's got yella-jackets in his drawers, but that's all so far. Ever' 
time the guys is around she shows up. She's lookin' for Curley, or 
she thought she lef' sotnethin' layin' around and she's lookin' for 
it. Seems like she can't keep away from guys. An' Curley's pants is 
just crawlin' with ants, but they ain't nothing come of it yet." 
 
 George said, "She's gonna make a mess. They's gonna be a bad 
mess about her. She's a jail bait all set on the trigger. That Curley

--- Chunk 10 ---
got that letter," she said. "I always thought my of lady stole it. 
Well, I wasn't gonna stay no place where I couldn't get nowhere or 
make something of myself, an' where they stole your letters. I ast 
her if she stole it, too, an' she says no. So I married Curley. Met 
him out to the Riverside Dance Palace that same night." She 
demanded, "You listenin'?" 
 
 "Me? Sure." 
 
 "Well, I ain't told this to nobody before. Maybe I ought'n to. I

--- Chunk 11 ---
an' lend a hand. I ain't so crippled I can't work like a son-of-a-bitch 
if I want to." 
 
 "Any you boys seen Curley?" 
 
 They swung their heads toward the door. Looking in was Curley's 
wife. Her face was heavily made up. Her lips were slightly parted. 
She breathed strongly, as though she had been running. 
 
 "Curley ain't been here," Candy said sourly. 
 
 She stood still in the doorway, smiling a little at them, rubbing 
the nails of one hand with the thumb and forefinger of the other.

--- Chunk 12 ---
looked sullenly up at her.She said, "What you got there, sonny 
boy?" 
 
 Lennie glared at her. "George says I ain't to have nothing to do 
with you-talk to you or nothing." 
 
 She laughed "George giving you orders about everything?" 
 
 Lennie looked down at the hay. "Says I can't tend no rabbits if I 
talk to you or anything." 
 
 She said quietly, "He's scared Curley'll get mad. Well, Curley got 
his arm in a sling-an' if Curley gets tough, you can break his other

--- Chunk 13 ---
But Candy said excitedly, "We oughtta let'im get away. You don't 
know that Curley. Curley gon'ta wanta get 'im lynched. Curley'll 
get 'im killed." 
 
 George watched Candy's lips. "Yeah," he said at last, "that's right, 
Curley will. An' the other guys will." And he looked back at 
Curley's wife. 
 
 Now Candy spoke his greatest fear. "You an' me can get that little 
place, can't we, George? You an' me can go there an' live nice, can't 
we, George? Can't we?"

--- Chunk 14 ---
together and turned around to Lennie. Lennie was lying down on 
the bunk watching him. 
 
 "Look, Lennie! This here ain't no set up. I'm scared. You gonna 
have trouble with that Curley guy. I seen that kind before. He was 
kinda feelin' you out. He figures he's got you scared and he's 
gonna take a sock at you the first chance he gets." 
 
 Lennie's eyes were frightened. "I don't want no trouble," he said 
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George."

--- Chunk 15 ---
ask him." 
 
 "A brown and white one," Lennie cried excitedly. 
 
 "Come on. Le's get dinner. I don't know whether he got a brown 
and white one." 
 
 Lennie didn't move from his bunk. "You ask him right away, 
George, so he won't kill no more of em." 
 
 "Sure. Come on now, get up on your feet." 
 
 Lennie rolled off his bunk and stood up, and the two of them 
started for the door. Just as they reached it, Curley bounced in. 
 
 "You seen a girl around here?" he demanded angrily.

and I pinched their heads a little and then they was dead - 
because they was so little. 
 
 "I wish’t we’d get the rabbits pretty soon, George. They ain’t so 
little." 
 
 "The hell with the rabbits. An’ you ain’t to be trusted with no live 
mice; Your Aunt Clara give you a rubber mouse and you wouldn’t 
have nothing to do with it." 
 
 "It wasn’t no good to pet," said Lennie. 
 
 The flame of the sunset lifted from the mountain-tops and dusk

--- Chunk 2 ---
George moved slowly after them, and his feet dragged heavily. 
 
 And when they were gone, Candy squatted down in the hay and 
watched the face of Curley's wife. "Poor bastard," he said softly. 
 
 The sound of the men grew fainter. The barn was darkening 
gradually and, in their stalls, the horses shifted their feet and 
rattled the halter chains. Old Candy lay down in the hay and 
covered his eyes with his arm.

 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the 
darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," 
George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of 
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined.

 She consoled him. "Don't you worry none. He was jus' a mutt. You 
can get another one easy. The whole country is fulla mutts." 
 
 "It ain't that so much," Lennie explained miserably. "George ain't 
gonna let me tend no rabbits now." 
 
 "Why don't he?" 
 
 "Well, he said if I done any more bad things he ain't gonna let me 
tend the rabbits."

 George looked quickly and searchingly at him. "I been mean, ain’t 
I?" 
 
 "If you don’ want me I can go off in the hills an’ find a cave. I can 
go away any time." 
 
 "No - look! I was jus’ foolin’, Lennie. ’Cause'. I want you to stay 
with me. Trouble with mice is you always kill ’em." He paused.

trigger. The crash of the shot rolled up the hills and rolled down 
again. Lennie jarred, and then settled slowly forward to the sand, 
and he lay without quivering. 
 
 George shivered and looked at the gun, and then he threw it from 
him, back up on the bank, near the pile of old ashes. 
 
 The brush seemed filled with cries and with the sound of running 
feet. Slim's voice shouted, "George. Where you at, George?" 
 
 But George sat stify on the bank and looked at his right hand

--- Chunk 12 ---
"All right. But don’t try to put nothing over, ’cause you can’t get 
away with nothing. I seen wise guys before. Go on out with the 
grain teams after dinner. They’re pickin’ up barley at the 
threshing machine. Go out with Slim’s team." 
 
 "Slim?" 
 
 "Yeah. Big tall skinner. You’ll see him at dinner." He turned 
abruptly and went to the door, but before he went out he turned 
and looked for a long moment at the two men. 
 
 When the sound of his footsteps had died away George turned on

Curley came suddenly to life. "I know who done it," he cried. 
"That big son-of-a-bitch done it. I know he done it. Why-ever'body

fury. "I'm gonna get him. I'm going for my shotgun. I'll kill the big 
son-of-a-bitch myself. I'll shoot 'im in the guts. Come on, you 
guys." He ran furiously out of the barn. Carlson said, "I'll get my

the mountains seemed to blaze with increasing brightness. 
 
 Lennie said softly, "I di'n't forget, you bet, God damn. Hide in the 
brush an' wait for George." He pulled his hat down low over his 
eyes. "George gonna give me hell," he said. "George gonna wish he 
was alone an' not have me botherin' him." He turned his head and 
looked at the bright mountain tops. "I can go right off there an'

 "Well, that won't do you no good if Curley wants to plug himself

 CHAPTER  6 
 
   
 
 THE deep green pool of the Salinas River was still in the late 
afternoon. Already the sun had left the valley to go climbing up 
the slopes of the Gabilan mountains, and the hilltops were rosy in 
the sun. But by the pool among the mottled sycamores, a pleasant 
shade had fallen. 
 
 A water snake glided smoothly up the pool, twist-ing its periscope 
head from side to side; and it swam the length of the pool and

--- Chunk 2 ---
buttoned it, and his black hat was pulled down low over his eyes. 
The men raced around the last stall. Their eyes found Curley's 
wife in the gloom, they stopped and stood still and looked. 
 
 Then Slim went quietly over to her, and he felt her wrist. One 
lean finger touched her cheek, and then his hand went under her 
slightly twisted neck and his fingers explored her neck. When he 
stood up the men crowded near and the spell was broken.

--- Chunk 3 ---
George took off his hat. He said shakily, "Take off your hat, 
Lennie. The air feels fine." 
 
 Lennie removed his hat dutifully and laid it on the ground in 
front of him. The shadow in the val-ley was bluer, and the evening 
came fast. On the wind the sound of crashing in the brush came to 
them. 
 
 Lennie said, "Tell how it's gonna be." 
 
 George had been listening to the distant sounds. For a moment he 
was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so

was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so 
you can almost see it." 
 
 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the 
darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," 
George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of 
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined.

George took off his hat. He said shakily, "Take off your hat, 
Lennie. The air feels fine." 
 
 Lennie removed his hat dutifully and laid it on the ground in

 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the 
darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," 
George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of 
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined.

--- Chunk 4 ---
silently as a creeping bear moves. The heron pounded the air with 
its wings, jacked itself clear of the water and flew off down river. 
The little snake slid in among the reeds at the pool's side. 
 
 Lennie came quietly to the pool's edge. He knelt down and drank, 
barely touching his lips to the water. When a little bird skittered 
over the dry leaves behind him, his head jerked up and he 
strained toward the sound with eyes and ears until he saw the

"For the rabbits," George repeated. 
 
 "And I get to tend the rabbits." 
 
 "An' you get to tend the rabbits." 
 
 Lennie giggled with happiness. "An' live on the fatta the lan'." 
 
 "Yes." 
 
 Lennie turned his head. 
 
 "No, Lennie. Look down there acrost the river, like you can 
almost see the place." 
 
 Lennie obeyed him. George looked down at the gun. 
 
 There were crashing footsteps in the brush now. George turned 
and looked toward them. 
 
 "Go on, George. When we gonna do it?"

brush. 
 
 "I won’t get in no trouble, George. I ain’t gonna say a word." 
 
 "O.K. Bring your bindle over here by the fire. It’s gonna be nice 
sleepin’ here. Lookin’ up, and the leaves. Don’t build up no more 
fire. We’ll let her die down." 
 
 They made their beds on the sand, and as the blaze dropped from 
the fire the sphere of light grew smaller; the curling branches 
disappeared and only a faint glimmer showed where the tree 
trunks were. From the darkness Lennie called, "George - you

--- Chunk 7 ---
find a cave," he said. And he continued sadly, "-an' never have no 
ketchup-but I won't care. If George don't want me . . . . I'll go 
away. I'll go away." 
 
 And then from out of Lennie's head there came a little fat old 
woman. She wore thick bull's-eye glasses and she wore a huge

--- Chunk 8 ---
But George sat stify on the bank and looked at his right hand 
that had thrown the gun away. The group burst into the clearing, 
and Curley was ahead. He saw Lennie lying on the sand. "Got 
him, by God." He went over and looked down at Lennie, and then 
he looked back at George. "Right in the back of the head," he said 
softly.

--- Chunk 9 ---
row on row of tiny wind waves flowed up the pool's green surface. 
 
 As quickly as it had come, the wind died, and the clearing was 
quiet again. The heron stood in the shallows, motionless and 
waiting. Another little water snake swam up the pool, turning its 
periscope head from side to side. 
 
   
 
 Suddenly Lennie appeared out of the brush, and he came as 
silently as a creeping bear moves. The heron pounded the air with

George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my

lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

What is the subject of the conversation Lennie has with his first visitor?

 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

into Lennie's brain. 
 
 George said quietly, "What the hell you yellin' about?" 
 
 Lennie got up on his knees. "You ain't gonna leave me, are ya, 
George? I know you ain't." 
 
 George came stiffly near and sat down beside him. 
 
 "No." 
 
 "I knowed it," Lennie cried. "You ain't that kind." 
 
 George was silent. 
 
 Lennie said, "George." 
 
 "Yeah ?" 
 
 "I done another bad thing." 
 
 "It don't make no difference," George said, and he fell silent 
again.

--- Chunk 3 ---
answered. 
 
  "Go on," said Lennie. 
 
 George raised the gun and his hands shook, and he dropped his 
hand to the ground again. 
 
 "Go on," said Lennie. "How's it gonna be. We gonna get a little 
place." 
 
 "We'll have a cow," said George. "An' we'll have maybe a pig an' 
chickens . . . . an' down the flat we'll have a . . . . little piece alfalfa-
" 
 
 "For the rabbits," Lennie shouted. 
 
 "For the rabbits," George repeated. 
 
 "And I get to tend the rabbits."

George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my

 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing

 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

what he's gonna do." 
 
 Now Lennie retorted belligerently, "He ain't neither. George won't 
do nothing like that. I've knew George since-1 forget when-and he 
ain't never raised his ban' to me with a stick. He's nice to me. He 
ain't gonna be mean." 
 
 "Well, he's sick of you," said the rabbit. "He's gonna beat hell outa 
you an' then go away an' leave you." 
 
 "He won't," Lennie cried frantically. "He won't do nothing like 
that. I know George. Me an' him travels together."

--- Chunk 6 ---
halter chains clinked. Outside, the men's voices became louder 
and clearer. 
 
 From around the end of the last stall old Candy's voice came. 
"Lennie," he called. "Oh, Lennie! You in here? 1 been figuring 
some more. Tell you what we can do, Lennie." Old Candy appeared

--- Chunk 7 ---
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined. 
 
 A man's voice called from up the river, and an-other man

was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so

 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the 
darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," 
George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of 
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined.

--- Chunk 9 ---
And Lennie answered her, "I tried, Aunt Clara, ma'am. I tried 
and tried. I couldn' help it." 
 
 "You never give a thought to George," she went on in Lennie's 
voice. "He been doin' nice things for you alla time. When he got a 
piece of pie you always got half or more'n half. An' if they was any 
ketchup, why he'd give it all to you." 
 
 "I know," said Lennie miserably. "I tried, Aunt Clara, ma'am. I

 She interrupted him. "All the time he coulda had such a good

George took off his hat. He said shakily, "Take off your hat, 
Lennie. The air feels fine." 
 
 Lennie removed his hat dutifully and laid it on the ground in

came fast. On the wind the sound of crashing in the brush came to 
them.

 George had been listening to the distant sounds. For a moment he

 Lennie said craftily- "Tell me like you done before." 
 
 "Tell you what?" 
 
 "'Bout the other guys an' about us." 
 
 George said, "Guys like us got no fambly. They make a little stake 
an' then they blow it in. They ain't got nobody in the worl' that

 "But not us," Lennie cried happily. "Tell about us now."

drop. For a moment he seemed bewildered. And then he whispered 
in fright, "I done a bad thing. I done another bad thing." 
 
 He pawed up the hay until it partly covered her. 
 
 From outside the barn came a cry of men and the double clang of 
shoes on metal. For the first time Lennie became conscious of the

right off in the hills an' I'll fin' a cave an' I'll live there so I won't 
be no more trouble to George."


=== Question 55 ===
What does his second visitor tell Lennie that recalls an earlier conversation he had with Crooks?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Slim says I ain't to pet 'em very much." 
 
 Crooks said, "Well, you been takin' 'em out of the nest all the 
time. I wonder the old lady don't move 'em someplace else." 
 
 "Oh, she don't care. She lets me." Lennie had moved into the room 
again. 
 
 Crooks scowled, but Lennie's disarming smile defeated him. 
"Come on in and set a while," Crooks said. "'Long as you won't get 
out and leave me alone, you might as well set down." His tone was

--- Chunk 2 ---
Crooks bored in on him. "Want me to tell ya what'll happen? 
They'll take ya to the booby hatch. They'll tie ya up with a collar, 
like a dog." 
 
 Suddenly Lennie's eyes. centered and grew quiet, and mad. He 
stood up and walked dangerously toward Crooks. "Who hurt 
George?" he demanded. 
 
 Crooks saw the danger as it approached him. He edged back on 
his bunk to get out of the way. "I was just supposin'," he said. 
"George ain't hurt. He's all right. He'll be back all right."

--- Chunk 3 ---
somebody's out there," Crooks said. "Maybe Slim. Slim comes in 
sometimes two, three times a night. Slim's a real skinner. He 
looks out for his team." He pulled himself painfully upright and 
moved toward the door. "That you, Slim?" he called. 
 
 Candy's voice answered. "Slim went in town. Say, you seen 
Lennie?" 
 
 "Ya mean the big guy?" 
 
 "Yeah. Seen him around any place?" 
 
 "He's in here," Crooks said shortly. He went back to his bunk and 
lay down.

--- Chunk 4 ---
"He won't do it," Lennie cried. "George wouldn't do nothing like 
that. I been with George a long time. He'll come back tonight-" But 
the doubt was too much for him. "Don't you think he will?" 
 
 Crooks' face lighted with pleasure in his torture. 
 
 "Nobody can't tell what a guy'll do," he observed calmly. "Le's say 
he wants to come back and can't. S'pose he gets killed or hurt so 
he can't come back." 
 
 Lennie struggled to understand. "George won't do nothing like

--- Chunk 5 ---
knew till long later why he didn't like that. But I know now." He 
hesitated, and when he spoke again his voice was softer. "There 
wasn't another colored family for miles around. And now there 
ain't a colored man on this ranch an' there's jus' one family in 
Soledad." He laughed. "If I say something, why it's just a nigger 
sayin' it" 
 
 Lennie asked, "How long you think it'll be before them pups will 
be old enough to pet?" 
 
 Crooks laughed again. "A guy can talk to you an' be sure you

--- Chunk 6 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

Candy and Lennie stood up and went toward the door. Crooks 
called, "Candy!" 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "'Member what I said about hoein' and doin' odd jobs?" 
 
 "Yeah," said Candy. "I remember." 
 
 "Well, jus' forget it," said Crooks. "I didn' mean it. Jus' foolin'. I 
wouldn' want to go no place like that." 
 
 "Well, O.K., if you feel like that. Good-night"

--- Chunk 8 ---
Lennie, who had been following the conversation back and forth 
with his eyes, smiled complacency at the compliment. Slim looked 
approvingly at George for having given the compliment. He leaned 
over the table and snapped the corner of a loose card. "You guys 
travel around together?" His tone was friendly. It invited 
confidence without demanding it. 
 
 "Sure," said George. "We kinda look after each other." He 
indicated Lennie with his thumb. "He ain't bright. Hell of a good

system all at once, an' no messes. And he knows how much it's 
gonna set him back. These here jail baits is just set on the trigger

 Lennie followed his words admiringly, and moved his lips a little 
to keep up. George continued, "You remember Andy Cushman, 
Lennie? Went to grammar school?" 
 
 "The one that his old lady used to make hot cakes for the kids?" 
Lennie asked.

--- Chunk 10 ---
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George." 
 
 George got up and went over to Lennie's bunk and sat down on it. 
"I hate that kinda bastard," he said. "I seen plenty of 'em. Like the 
old guy says, Curley don't take no chances. He always wins." He 
thought for a moment. "If he tangles with you, Lennie, we're 
gonna get the can. Don't make no mistake about that. He's the 
boss's son. Look, Lennie. You try to keep away from him, will you?

--- Chunk 11 ---
together and turned around to Lennie. Lennie was lying down on 
the bunk watching him. 
 
 "Look, Lennie! This here ain't no set up. I'm scared. You gonna 
have trouble with that Curley guy. I seen that kind before. He was 
kinda feelin' you out. He figures he's got you scared and he's 
gonna take a sock at you the first chance he gets." 
 
 Lennie's eyes were frightened. "I don't want no trouble," he said 
plaintively. "Don't let him sock me, George."

--- Chunk 12 ---
place-an' rabbits," he explained. 
 
 She went on with her story quickly, before she should be 
interrupted. "'Nother time I met a guy, an' he was in pitchers. 
Went out to the Riverside Dance Palace with him. He says he was 
gonna put me in the movies. Says I was a natural. Soon's he got 
back to Hollywood he was gonna write to me about it." She looked 
closely at Lennie to see whether she was impressing him. "I never 
got that letter," she said. "I always thought my of lady stole it.

--- Chunk 13 ---
"Yeah, what ya want?" 
 
 "Where we goin’, George?" 
 
 The little man jerked down the brim of his hat and scowled over 
at Lennie. "So yon forgot that awready, did you? I gotta tell you 
again, do I? Jesus Christ, you’re a crazy bastard!" 
 
 "I forgot," Lennie said softly. "I tried not to forget. Honest to God I

--- Chunk 14 ---
'He better not fool with Lennie if he knows what's good for 'um.' 
That's jus' what you says to me." 
 
 George turned to Lennie. "It ain't your fault," he said. "You don't 
need to be scairt no more. You done jus' what I tol' you to. Maybe 
you better go in the ' wash room an' clean up your face. You look 
like' hell." 
 
 Lennie smiled with his bruised mouth. "I didn't want no trouble," 
he said. He walked toward the door, but just before he came to it, 
he turned back. "George?"

--- Chunk 15 ---
tickets?" 
 
 "Oh, sure, George. I remember that now." His hands went quickly 
into his side coat pockets. He said gently, "George.... I ain’t got 
mine. I musta lost it," He looked down at the ground in despair. 
 
 "You never had none, you crazy bastard. I got both of ’em here. 
Think I’d let you carry your own work card?" 
 
 Lennie grinned with relief. "I.... I thought I put it in my side 
pocket." His hand went into the pocket again.


=== Question 56 ===
How is George and Lennie's conversation similar to the one that they had by the pool in Chapter 1?

--- Chunk 1 ---
was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so 
you can almost see it." 
 
 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the 
darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," 
George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of 
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined.

--- Chunk 2 ---
so the water arose in little splashes; rings widened across the pool 
to the other side and came back again. Lennie watched them go. 
"Look, George. Look what I done." 
 
 George knelt beside the pool and drank from his hand with quick 
scoops. "Tastes all right," he admitted. "Don’t really seem to be 
running, though. You never oughta drink water when it ain’t 
running, Lennie," he said hopelessly. "You’d drink out of a gutter

--- Chunk 3 ---
George was quiet for a moment. "But not us," he said. 
 
   
 
 "Because-" 
 
 "Because I got you an'' 
 
 "An' I got you. We got each other, that's what, that gives a hoot in 
hell about us," Lennie cried in triumph. 
 
 The little evening breeze blew over the clearing and the leaves 
rustled and the wind waves flowed up the green pool. And the 
shouts of men sounded again, this time much closer than before. 
 
 George took off his hat. He said shakily, "Take off your hat,

--- Chunk 4 ---
Lennie giggled happily. "I didn’t forget that, you bet." 
 
 George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his 
head, and Lennie imitated him, raising his head to see whether he 
were doing it right. "God, you’re a lot of trouble," said George. "I 
could get along so easy and so nice if I didn’t have you on my tail. I 
could live so easy and maybe have a girl." 
 
 For a moment Lennie lay quiet, and then he said hopefully, "We 
gonna work on a ranch, George."

--- Chunk 5 ---
Lennie, who had been following the conversation back and forth 
with his eyes, smiled complacency at the compliment. Slim looked 
approvingly at George for having given the compliment. He leaned 
over the table and snapped the corner of a loose card. "You guys 
travel around together?" His tone was friendly. It invited 
confidence without demanding it. 
 
 "Sure," said George. "We kinda look after each other." He 
indicated Lennie with his thumb. "He ain't bright. Hell of a good

--- Chunk 6 ---
George didn't answer his question. George said, "I'll work my 
month an' I'll take my fifty bucks an' I'll stay all night in some 
lousy cat house. Or I'll set in some poolroom till ever'body goes 
home. An' then I'll come back an' work another month an! I'll have 
fifty bucks more." 
 
 Candy said, "He's such a nice fella. I didn' think he'd do nothing 
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in

--- Chunk 7 ---
"I wasn’t doin’ nothing bad with it, George. Jus’ strokin’ it." 
 
 George stood up and threw the mouse as far as he could into the 
darkening brush, and then he stepped to the pool and washed his 
hands. "You crazy fool. Don’t you think I could see your feet was 
wet where you went acrost the river to get it?" He heard Lennie’s 
whimpering cry and wheeled about. "Blubberin’ like a baby! Jesus 
Christ! A big guy like you." Lennie’s lip quivered and tears started

--- Chunk 8 ---
When the sound of his footsteps had died away George turned on 
Lennie. "So you wasn’t gonna say a word. You was gonna leave 
your big flapper shut and leave me do the talkin’. Damn near lost 
us the job." 
 
 Lennie stared hopelessly at his hands. "I forgot George." 
 
 "Yeah, you forgot. You always forget, an’ I got to talk you out of 
it." He sat down heavily on. the bunk. "Now he’s got his eye on us. 
Now we got to be careful and not make no slips. You keep your big

--- Chunk 9 ---
"For the rabbits," George repeated. 
 
 "And I get to tend the rabbits." 
 
 "An' you get to tend the rabbits." 
 
 Lennie giggled with happiness. "An' live on the fatta the lan'." 
 
 "Yes." 
 
 Lennie turned his head. 
 
 "No, Lennie. Look down there acrost the river, like you can 
almost see the place." 
 
 Lennie obeyed him. George looked down at the gun. 
 
 There were crashing footsteps in the brush now. George turned 
and looked toward them. 
 
 "Go on, George. When we gonna do it?"

--- Chunk 10 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

--- Chunk 11 ---
Lennie choked with pride. "I can remember," he said. 
 
 George motioned with his spoon again. "Look, Lennie. I want you 
to look around here. You can remember this place, can’t you? The 
ranch is about a quarter mile up that way. Just follow the river?" 
 
 "Sure," said Lennie. "I can remember this. Di’n’t I remember 
about not gonna say a word?" 
 
 "’Course you did. Well, look Lennie - if you jus’ happen to get in 
trouble like you always done be fore, I want you to come right here

--- Chunk 12 ---
every damn month. Get a gallon of whisky, or set in a pool room 
and play cards or shoot pool." Lennie knelt and looked over the 
fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s face was drawn with terror. 
"An’ whatta I got," George went on furiously. "I got you! You can’t 
keep a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me shovin’ all 
over the country all the time. An’ that ain’t the,' worst. You get in 
trouble. You do bad things and I got m get you out." His voice rose

--- Chunk 13 ---
But George sat stify on the bank and looked at his right hand 
that had thrown the gun away. The group burst into the clearing, 
and Curley was ahead. He saw Lennie lying on the sand. "Got 
him, by God." He went over and looked down at Lennie, and then 
he looked back at George. "Right in the back of the head," he said 
softly.

--- Chunk 14 ---
sat down at the table, across from George. Almost automatically 
George shuffled the cards and laid out his solitaire hand. He used 
a deliberate, thoughtful, slowness. 
 
 Lennie reached for a face card and studied it, then turned it 
upside down and studied it. "Both ends the same," he said. 
"George, why is it both end's the same?" 
 
 "I don't know," said George. "That's jus' the way they make 'em. 
What was Slim doin' in the barn when you seen him?" 
 
 "Slim?"

--- Chunk 15 ---
into Lennie's brain. 
 
 George said quietly, "What the hell you yellin' about?" 
 
 Lennie got up on his knees. "You ain't gonna leave me, are ya, 
George? I know you ain't." 
 
 George came stiffly near and sat down beside him. 
 
 "No." 
 
 "I knowed it," Lennie cried. "You ain't that kind." 
 
 George was silent. 
 
 Lennie said, "George." 
 
 "Yeah ?" 
 
 "I done another bad thing." 
 
 "It don't make no difference," George said, and he fell silent 
again.


=== Question 57 ===
Where has George gotten the gun he takes from his front pocket while sitting with Lennie on the river bank?

--- Chunk 1 ---
was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so 
you can almost see it." 
 
 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the 
darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," 
George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of 
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined.

--- Chunk 2 ---
But George sat stify on the bank and looked at his right hand 
that had thrown the gun away. The group burst into the clearing, 
and Curley was ahead. He saw Lennie lying on the sand. "Got 
him, by God." He went over and looked down at Lennie, and then 
he looked back at George. "Right in the back of the head," he said 
softly.

--- Chunk 3 ---
hand. He put an ace up on his scoring rack and piled a two, three 
and four of diamonds on it. "Andy's in San Quentin right now on 
account of a tart," said George. 
 
 Lennie drummed on the table with his fingers. "George?" 
 
 "Huh?" 
 
 "George, how long's it gonna be till we get that little place an' live 
on the fatta the lan-an' rabbits?" 
 
 "I don' know," said George. "We gotta get a big stake together. I 
know a little place we can get cheap, but they ain't givin' it away."

--- Chunk 4 ---
trigger. The crash of the shot rolled up the hills and rolled down 
again. Lennie jarred, and then settled slowly forward to the sand, 
and he lay without quivering. 
 
 George shivered and looked at the gun, and then he threw it from 
him, back up on the bank, near the pile of old ashes. 
 
 The brush seemed filled with cries and with the sound of running 
feet. Slim's voice shouted, "George. Where you at, George?" 
 
 But George sat stify on the bank and looked at his right hand

--- Chunk 5 ---
Slim came directly to George and sat down beside him, sat very 
close to him. "Never you mind," said Slim. "A guy got to 
sometimes." 
 
 But Carlson was standing over George. "How'd you do it?" he 
asked. 
 
 "I just done it," George said tiredly. 
 
 "Did he have my gun?" 
 
 "Yeah. He had your gun." 
 
 "An' you got it away from him and you took it an' you killed him?" 
 
 "Yeah. Tha's how." George's voice was almost a whisper. He

"For the rabbits," George repeated. 
 
 "And I get to tend the rabbits." 
 
 "An' you get to tend the rabbits." 
 
 Lennie giggled with happiness. "An' live on the fatta the lan'." 
 
 "Yes." 
 
 Lennie turned his head. 
 
 "No, Lennie. Look down there acrost the river, like you can 
almost see the place." 
 
 Lennie obeyed him. George looked down at the gun. 
 
 There were crashing footsteps in the brush now. George turned

every damn month. Get a gallon of whisky, or set in a pool room 
and play cards or shoot pool." Lennie knelt and looked over the 
fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s face was drawn with terror. 
"An’ whatta I got," George went on furiously. "I got you! You can’t 
keep a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me shovin’ all 
over the country all the time. An’ that ain’t the,' worst. You get in 
trouble. You do bad things and I got m get you out." His voice rose

--- Chunk 8 ---
answered. 
 
  "Go on," said Lennie. 
 
 George raised the gun and his hands shook, and he dropped his 
hand to the ground again. 
 
 "Go on," said Lennie. "How's it gonna be. We gonna get a little 
place." 
 
 "We'll have a cow," said George. "An' we'll have maybe a pig an' 
chickens . . . . an' down the flat we'll have a . . . . little piece alfalfa-
" 
 
 "For the rabbits," Lennie shouted. 
 
 "For the rabbits," George repeated. 
 
 "And I get to tend the rabbits."

--- Chunk 9 ---
"Yeah. Tha's how." George's voice was almost a whisper. He 
looked steadily at his right hand that had held the gun. 
 
 Slim twitched George's elbow. "Come on, George. Me an' you'll go 
in an' get a drink." 
 
 George let himself be helped to his feet. "Yeah, a drink." 
 
 Slim said, "You hadda, George. I swear you had-da. Come on with 
me." He led George into the entrance of the trail and up toward 
the highway. 
 
 Curley and Carlson looked after them. And Carlson said, "Now

--- Chunk 10 ---
puttin’ nothing over." 
 
 Lennie hesitated, backed away, looked wildly at the brush line as 
though he contemplated running for his freedom. George said 
coldly, "You gonna give me that mouse or do I have to sock you?" 
 
 "Give you what, George?" 
 
 "You know God damn well what. I want that mouse." 
 
 Lennie reluctantly reached into his pocket. His voice broke a 
little. "I don’t know why I can’t keep it. It ain’t nobody’s mouse. I 
didn’t steal it. I found it lyin’ right beside the road."

--- Chunk 11 ---
Lennie said, "I like beans with ketchup." 
 
 "Well, we ain’t got no ketchup. You go get wood. An’ don’t you fool 
around. It’ll be dark before long." 
 
 Lennie lumbered to his feet and disappeared in the brush. George 
lay where he was and whistled softly to himself. There were 
sounds of splashings down the river in the direction Lennie had 
taken. George stopped whistling and listened, "Poor bastard," he 
said softly, and then went on whistling again.

--- Chunk 12 ---
The voices came close now. George raised the gun and listened to 
the voices. 
 
 Lennie begged, "Le's do it now. Le's get that place now." 
 
 "Sure, right now. I gotta. We gotta." 
 
 And George raised the gun and steadied it, and he brought the 
muzzle of it close to the back of Lennie's head. The hand shook 
violently, but his face set and his hand steadied. He pulled the 
trigger. The crash of the shot rolled up the hills and rolled down

--- Chunk 13 ---
Maybe you wouldn’t killit. That’d be better than. mice. And you 
could pet it harder." 
 
 Lennie avoided the bait. He had sensed his advantage, "If you 
don’t want me, you only jus’ got to say so, and I’ll go off in those 
hills right there - right up in those hills and live by myself. An’ I 
won’t get no mice stole from me." 
 
 George said, "I want you to stay with me, Lennie. Jesus Christ, 
somebody’d shoot you for a coyote if you was by yourself. No, you

--- Chunk 14 ---
Lennie choked with pride. "I can remember," he said. 
 
 George motioned with his spoon again. "Look, Lennie. I want you 
to look around here. You can remember this place, can’t you? The 
ranch is about a quarter mile up that way. Just follow the river?" 
 
 "Sure," said Lennie. "I can remember this. Di’n’t I remember

 "’Course you did. Well, look Lennie - if you jus’ happen to get in

--- Chunk 15 ---
we'll shoot 'im. " 
 
 George said weakly, "Maybe Carlson lost his gun.,, 
 
 "I seen it this morning," said Carlson. "No, it's been took." 
 
 Slim stood looking down at Curley's wife. He said, "Curley-maybe 
you better stay here with your wife." 
 
 Curley's face reddened. "I'm goin'," he said. "I'm gonna shoot the 
guts outa that big bastard myself, even if I only got one hand. I'm 
gonna get 'im." 
 
 Slim turned to Candy. "You stay here with her then, Candy. The

--- Chunk 2 ---
"He won't do it," Lennie cried. "George wouldn't do nothing like 
that. I been with George a long time. He'll come back tonight-" But 
the doubt was too much for him. "Don't you think he will?" 
 
 Crooks' face lighted with pleasure in his torture. 
 
 "Nobody can't tell what a guy'll do," he observed calmly. "Le's say 
he wants to come back and can't. S'pose he gets killed or hurt so 
he can't come back." 
 
 Lennie struggled to understand. "George won't do nothing like

--- Chunk 3 ---
with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at ’em because he ain’t a big 
guy. You seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?" 
 
 "Sure," said George. "I seen plenty tough little guys. But this 
Curley better not make no mistakes about Lennie. Lennie ain’t 
handy, but this Curley punk is gonna get' hurt if he messes

But George sat stify on the bank and looked at his right hand 
that had thrown the gun away. The group burst into the clearing,

George stepped close. "Couldn' we maybe bring him in an' they'll

 Slim nodded. "We might," he said. "If we could keep Curley in, we 
might. But Curley's gonna want to shoot 'im. Curley's still mad 
about his hand. An' s'pose they lock him up an' strap him down

 "I know," said George. "I know."

 Lennie begged, "Le's do it now. Le's get that place now."

 Lennie followed his words admiringly, and moved his lips a little 
to keep up. George continued, "You remember Andy Cushman,

 "The one that his old lady used to make hot cakes for the kids?" 
Lennie asked.

terror. He shook her then, and he was angry with her. "Don't you 
go yellin'," he said, and he shook her; and her body flopped like a 
fish. And then she was still, for Lennie had broken her neck. 
 
 He looked down at her, and carefully be removed his hand from 
over her mouth, and she lay still. "I don't want to hurt you," he 
said, "but George'll be mad if you yell." When she didn't answer

 "Yeah, you forgot. You always forget, an’ I got to talk you out of 
it." He sat down heavily on. the bunk. "Now he’s got his eye on us. 
Now we got to be careful and not make no slips. You keep your big

every damn month. Get a gallon of whisky, or set in a pool room 
and play cards or shoot pool." Lennie knelt and looked over the 
fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s face was drawn with terror. 
"An’ whatta I got," George went on furiously. "I got you! You can’t 
keep a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me shovin’ all 
over the country all the time. An’ that ain’t the,' worst. You get in 
trouble. You do bad things and I got m get you out." His voice rose

wall. "You tol' me to, George," he said miserably. 
 
 Curley sat down on the floor, looking in wonder at his crushed 
hand. Slim and Carlson bent over him. Then Slim straightened up 
and regarded Lennie with horror. "We got to get him in to a 
doctor," he said. "Looks to me like ever' bone in his han' is bust." 
 
 "I didn't wanta," Lennie cried. "I didn't wanta hurt him." 
 
 Slim said, "Carlson, you get the candy wagon hitched up. We'll

--- Chunk 5 ---
"He won't do it," Lennie cried. "George wouldn't do nothing like 
that. I been with George a long time. He'll come back tonight-" But 
the doubt was too much for him. "Don't you think he will?" 
 
 Crooks' face lighted with pleasure in his torture. 
 
 "Nobody can't tell what a guy'll do," he observed calmly. "Le's say 
he wants to come back and can't. S'pose he gets killed or hurt so 
he can't come back." 
 
 Lennie struggled to understand. "George won't do nothing like

--- Chunk 6 ---
Lennie said, "Well, I ain't supposed to. George's scared I'll get in 
trouble." 
 
 She changed the subject. "What you got covered up there?" 
 
 Then all of Lennie's woe came back on him. "Joe my pup," he said 
sadly. "Jus' my little pup." And he swept the hay from on top of it. 
 
 "Why, he's dead," she cried. 
 
 "He was so little," said Lennie. "I was jus' playin' with him . . . . 
an' he made like he's gonna bite me . . . . an' I made like I was

--- Chunk 7 ---
like this." 
 
 George still stared at Curley's wife. "Lennie never done it in 
meanness," he said "All the time he done bad things, but he never 
done one of 'em mean." He straightened up and looked back at 
Candy. "Now listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him 
in, I guess. They ain't no way out. Maybe they won't hurt'im." He 
said sharply, "I ain't gonna let 'em hurt Lennie. Now you listen. 
The guys might think I was in on it. I'm gonna go in the bunk

--- Chunk 8 ---
tried and tried." 
 
 She interrupted him. "All the time he coulda had such a good 
time if it wasn't for you. He woulda took his pay an' raised hell in 
a whore house, and he coulda set in a poolroom an' played 
snooker. But he got to take care of you." 
 
 Lennie moaned with grief. "I know, Aunt Clara, ma'am. I'll go 
right off in the hills an' I'll fin' a cave an' I'll live there so I won't 
be no more trouble to George."

--- Chunk 9 ---
'He better not fool with Lennie if he knows what's good for 'um.' 
That's jus' what you says to me." 
 
 George turned to Lennie. "It ain't your fault," he said. "You don't 
need to be scairt no more. You done jus' what I tol' you to. Maybe 
you better go in the ' wash room an' clean up your face. You look 
like' hell." 
 
 Lennie smiled with his bruised mouth. "I didn't want no trouble," 
he said. He walked toward the door, but just before he came to it, 
he turned back. "George?"

--- Chunk 10 ---
"I never meant no harm, George. Honest I never." 
 
 "Well, you keep away from her, 'cause she's a rattrap if I ever 
seen one. You let Curley take the rap. He let himself in for it. 
Glove fulla vaseline," George said disgustedly. "An' I bet he's eatin' 
raw eggs and writin' to the patent medicine houses." 
 
 Lennie cried out suddenly-"I don' like this place, George. This 
ain't no good place. I wanna get outa here." 
 
 "We gotta keep it till we get a stake. We can't help it, Lennie.

--- Chunk 11 ---
into Lennie's brain. 
 
 George said quietly, "What the hell you yellin' about?" 
 
 Lennie got up on his knees. "You ain't gonna leave me, are ya, 
George? I know you ain't." 
 
 George came stiffly near and sat down beside him. 
 
 "No." 
 
 "I knowed it," Lennie cried. "You ain't that kind." 
 
 George was silent. 
 
 Lennie said, "George." 
 
 "Yeah ?" 
 
 "I done another bad thing." 
 
 "It don't make no difference," George said, and he fell silent 
again.

--- Chunk 12 ---
terror. He shook her then, and he was angry with her. "Don't you 
go yellin'," he said, and he shook her; and her body flopped like a 
fish. And then she was still, for Lennie had broken her neck. 
 
 He looked down at her, and carefully be removed his hand from 
over her mouth, and she lay still. "I don't want to hurt you," he 
said, "but George'll be mad if you yell." When she didn't answer 
nor move he bent closely over her. He lifted her arm and let it

with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at ’em because he ain’t a big 
guy. You seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?" 
 
 "Sure," said George. "I seen plenty tough little guys. But this 
Curley better not make no mistakes about Lennie. Lennie ain’t 
handy, but this Curley punk is gonna get' hurt if he messes

--- Chunk 14 ---
Curley's wife moved away from him a little. "I think you're nuts," 
she said. 
 
 "No I ain't," Lennie explained earnestly. "George says I ain't. I 
like to pet nice things with my fingers, sof' things. " 
 
 She was a little bit reassured. "Well, who don't?" she said. 
"Ever'body likes that. I like to feel silk an' velvet. Do you like to 
feel velvet?" 
 
 Lennie chuckled with pleasure. "You bet, by God," he cried 
happily. "An' I had some, too. A lady give me some, an' that lady

--- Chunk 15 ---
But George sat stify on the bank and looked at his right hand 
that had thrown the gun away. The group burst into the clearing, 
and Curley was ahead. He saw Lennie lying on the sand. "Got 
him, by God." He went over and looked down at Lennie, and then 
he looked back at George. "Right in the back of the head," he said 
softly.


=== Question 60 ===
What evidence is there that Slim understands what has really happened there on the river bank?

--- Chunk 1 ---
Slim is. But I like to see the fuss if it comes off. Come on, le's go." 
 
 George said, "I'm stayin' right here. I don't want to get mixed up 
in nothing. Lennie and me got to make a stake."

--- Chunk 2 ---
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined. 
 
 A man's voice called from up the river, and an-other man

--- Chunk 3 ---
was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so 
you can almost see it." 
 
 Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the 
darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," 
George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out 
Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun 
lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of 
Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined.

--- Chunk 4 ---
"That's not what I meant. You remember where we slep' last 
night? Down by the river?" 
 
 "Yeah. I remember. Oh, sure I remember! I go there an' hide in 
the brush." 
 
 "Hide till I come for you. Don't let nobody see you. Hide in the 
brush by the river. Say that over." 
 
 "Hide in the brush by the river, down in the brush by the river." 
 
 "If you get in trouble." 
 
 "If I get in trouble." 
 
 A brake screeched outside. A call came, "StableBuck. Oh! Sta-able 
Buck."

trigger. The crash of the shot rolled up the hills and rolled down 
again. Lennie jarred, and then settled slowly forward to the sand, 
and he lay without quivering. 
 
 George shivered and looked at the gun, and then he threw it from 
him, back up on the bank, near the pile of old ashes. 
 
 The brush seemed filled with cries and with the sound of running 
feet. Slim's voice shouted, "George. Where you at, George?" 
 
 But George sat stify on the bank and looked at his right hand

--- Chunk 6 ---
But George sat stify on the bank and looked at his right hand 
that had thrown the gun away. The group burst into the clearing, 
and Curley was ahead. He saw Lennie lying on the sand. "Got 
him, by God." He went over and looked down at Lennie, and then 
he looked back at George. "Right in the back of the head," he said 
softly.

--- Chunk 7 ---
Lennie and says, 'Jump in.' An' he jumps. Couldn't swim a stroke. 
He damn near drowned before we could get him. An' he was so 
damn nice to me for pullin' him out. Clean forgot I told him to 
jump in. Well, I ain't done nothing like that no more." 
 
 "He's a nice fella," said Slim. "Guy don't need no sense to be a nice 
fella. Seems to me sometimes it jus' works the other way around. 
Take a real smart guy and he ain't hardly ever a nice fella."

--- Chunk 8 ---
"Yeah. Tha's how." George's voice was almost a whisper. He 
looked steadily at his right hand that had held the gun. 
 
 Slim twitched George's elbow. "Come on, George. Me an' you'll go 
in an' get a drink." 
 
 George let himself be helped to his feet. "Yeah, a drink." 
 
 Slim said, "You hadda, George. I swear you had-da. Come on with 
me." He led George into the entrance of the trail and up toward 
the highway. 
 
 Curley and Carlson looked after them. And Carlson said, "Now

--- Chunk 9 ---
Slim went on, "Maybe like that time in Weed you was tellin' 
about." 
 
 Again George nodded. 
 
 Slim sighed. "Well, I guess we got to get him. Where you think he 
might of went?" 
 
 It seemed to take George some time to free his words. "He-would 
of went south," he said. "We come from north so he would of went 
south." 
 
 "I guess we gotta get 'im," Slim repeated. 
 
 George stepped close. "Couldn' we maybe bring him in an' they'll

--- Chunk 10 ---
Slim came directly to George and sat down beside him, sat very 
close to him. "Never you mind," said Slim. "A guy got to 
sometimes." 
 
 But Carlson was standing over George. "How'd you do it?" he 
asked. 
 
 "I just done it," George said tiredly. 
 
 "Did he have my gun?" 
 
 "Yeah. He had your gun." 
 
 "An' you got it away from him and you took it an' you killed him?" 
 
 "Yeah. Tha's how." George's voice was almost a whisper. He

--- Chunk 11 ---
George took off his hat. He said shakily, "Take off your hat, 
Lennie. The air feels fine." 
 
 Lennie removed his hat dutifully and laid it on the ground in 
front of him. The shadow in the val-ley was bluer, and the evening 
came fast. On the wind the sound of crashing in the brush came to 
them. 
 
 Lennie said, "Tell how it's gonna be." 
 
 George had been listening to the distant sounds. For a moment he 
was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so

Thought:The latest Burning Man event was severely affected by heavy rainfall that led to flooding. This resulted in tens of thousands of festival attendees getting stuck in their camps due to the muddy conditions. As a result, the exodus from the festival was delayed. An unfortunate incident also occurred, with a death being investigated at the festival. The situation was severe enough that President Biden was informed about it and administration officials were monitoring it. However, it seems that the festival goers were able to handle the situation well, as the Burning Man community is known for looking out for each other. This is not the first time a rainstorm has disrupted the Burning Man event; a similar incident occurred in 2013 where a sudden storm trapped people overnight.

Lennie said, "I like beans with ketchup." 
 
 "Well, we ain’t got no ketchup. You go get wood. An’ don’t you fool 
around. It’ll be dark before long." 
 
 Lennie lumbered to his feet and disappeared in the brush. George 
lay where he was and whistled softly to himself. There were 
sounds of splashings down the river in the direction Lennie had 
taken. George stopped whistling and listened, "Poor bastard," he 
said softly, and then went on whistling again.

so the water arose in little splashes; rings widened across the pool 
to the other side and came back again. Lennie watched them go. 
"Look, George. Look what I done." 
 
 George knelt beside the pool and drank from his hand with quick 
scoops. "Tastes all right," he admitted. "Don’t really seem to be 
running, though. You never oughta drink water when it ain’t 
running, Lennie," he said hopelessly. "You’d drink out of a gutter

"Curley's just spoilin' or he wouldn't start for Slim. An' Curley's 
handy, God damn handy. Got in the finals for the Golden Gloves. 
He got newspaper clippings about it." He considered. "But jus' the 
same, he better leave Slim alone. Nobody don't know what Slim 
can do." 
 
 "Thinks Slim's with his wife, don't he?" said George. 
 
 "Looks like it," Whit said. "'Course Slim ain't. Least I don't think 
Slim is. But I like to see the fuss if it comes off. Come on, le's go."
