Claude can understand natural language prompts and provide helpful responses.\n\n- Use Constitutional AI if you need an AI assistant that is harmless, honest, and helpful. It is designed to be safe and aligned with human values.\n\n- Use Writer to generate natural language content for things like marketing copy, stories, reports, and more. Give it a topic and prompt and it will create high-quality written content.\n\n- Check out Anthropic's documentation and blog for tips, tutorials, examples, and announcements about new capabilities as they continue to develop their AI technology.\n\n- Follow Anthropic on social media or subscribe to their newsletter to stay up to date on new features and releases.\n\n- For</doc_content>

<doc_content>## Prompting Best Practices‚Äã

Anthropic models have several prompting best practices compared to OpenAI models.

**No System Messages**

Anthropic models are not trained on the concept of a "system message".
We have worked with the Anthropic team to handle them somewhat appropriately (a Human message with an `admin` tag)
but this is largely a hack and it is recommended that you do not use system messages.

**AI Messages Can Continue**

A completion from Claude is a continuation of the last text in the string which allows you further control over Claude's output.
For example, putting words in Claude's mouth in a prompt like this:

`\n\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\n\nAssistant: What do you call a bear with no teeth?`

This will return a completion like this `A gummy bear!` instead of a whole new assistant message with a different random bear joke.

All functionality related to Anthropic models.

[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) is an AI safety and research company, and is the creator of Claude.
This page covers all integrations between Anthropic models and LangChain.

## Prompting Overview‚Äã

Claude is chat-based model, meaning it is trained on conversation data.
However, it is a text based API, meaning it takes in single string.
It expects this string to be in a particular format.
This means that it is up the user to ensure that is the case.
LangChain provides several utilities and helper functions to make sure prompts that you write -
whether formatted as a string or as a list of messages - end up formatted correctly.</doc_content>

This template will create a virtual research assistant with the ability to search Wikipedia to find answers to your questions.

It is heavily inspired by [this notebook](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/long_context/wikipedia-search-cookbook.ipynb).

## Environment Setup‚Äã

Set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable to access the Anthropic models.

## Usage‚Äã

To use this package, you should first have the LangChain CLI installed:

```shell
pip install -U langchain-cli
```

To create a new LangChain project and install this as the only package, you can do:

```shell
langchain app new my-app --package anthropic-iterative-search
```

If you want to add this to an existing project, you can just run:

```shell
langchain app add anthropic-iterative-search
```

And add the following code to your `server.py` file:</doc_content>

Hypotheitcal Answer: To determine how to run GPT-4 on Anthropic, follow these organized steps:

1. **Check Anthropic Documentation**: Visit Anthropic's official documentation or website to see if they support Bring Your Own Model (BYOM). This will indicate if integrating 
external models like GPT-4 is possible.

2. **Research Community Solutions**: Look into forums, Reddit, Stack Overflow, and GitHub repositories for community workarounds or integrations. Someone might have developed a 
script or guide for this purpose.

3. **Contact Anthropic Support**: Reach out to Anthropic's support team directly. They can provide definitive information on whether running GPT-4 is feasible and offer any 
necessary steps or features available.

4. **Consider Licensing Issues**: Ensure that using GPT-4 on Anthropic complies with OpenAI's licensing terms, as there may be restrictions on where their models can be deployed.

5. **Evaluate Technical Requirements**: Check if GPT-4 has specific hardware needs and whether Anthropic's platform can support those requirements without additional 
configurations.

6. **Explore Collaborations**: Investigate if there are any partnerships or collaborations between OpenAI and Anthropic that allow for model sharing or integration, which might 
offer an official method to use GPT-4 on the platform.

By following these steps, you can systematically explore the possibility of running GPT-4 on Anthropic and determine the best approach based on available options and constraints.



Answer: You cannot run GPT-4 on Anthropic as they are separate companies with distinct models.
