<doc_content>**Caching**

Respond to previously served customers queries from cache instead of sending them again to OpenAI. Match exact strings OR semantically similar strings. Cache can save costs and reduce latencies by 20x.

**Retries**

Automatically reprocess any unsuccessful API requests **upto 5** times. Uses an **exponential backoff** strategy, which spaces out retry attempts to prevent network overload.</doc_content>

<doc_content>Be aware the API version may change.
You can also specify the version of the model using model_version constructor
parameter, as Azure OpenAI doesn’t return model version with the response.
Default is empty. When you specify the version, it will be appended to the
model name in the response. Setting correct version will help you to calculate the
cost properly. Model version is not validated, so make sure you set it correctly
to get the correct cost.
Any parameters that are valid to be passed to the openai.create call can be passed
in, even if not explicitly saved on this class.
Create a new model by parsing and validating input data from keyword arguments.
Raises ValidationError if the input data cannot be parsed to form a valid model.</doc_content>

<doc_content>A **fallback** is an alternative plan that may be used in an emergency.

Crucially, fallbacks can be applied not only on the LLM level but on the whole runnable level. This is important because often times different models require different prompts. So if your call to OpenAI fails, you don't just want to send the same prompt to Anthropic - you probably want to use a different prompt template and send a different version there.

## Fallback for LLM API Errors​</doc_content>

Answer: To handle OpenAI rate limiting, you can implement fallbacks, which are alternative plans that may be used in an emergency. Fallbacks can be applied not only on the LLM level but on the whole runnable level, allowing you to use different prompts and models if your call to OpenAI fails.

Here's some sample code:
```
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.1)
# Create a fallback model
fallback_llm = Anthropic(temperature=0.1)

questions = questions[0:num_questions]
for question in questions:
    try:
        llm_result = llm.generate([question])
    except RateLimitError:
        # Fallback to the alternative model if OpenAI rate limits
        llm_result = fallback_llm.generate([question])
    print(llm_result)
```
Note that this code is just a sample and you may need to adjust it according to your specific use case.
