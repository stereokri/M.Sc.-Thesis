[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) is the fast and resource efficient open-source database for real-time
apps and analytics with full SQL support and a wide range of functions to assist users in writing analytical queries.
It has data structures and distance search functions (like `L2Distance`) as well as
[approximate nearest neighbor search indexes](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/annindexes)
That enables ClickHouse to be used as a high performance and scalable vector database to store and search vectors with SQL.

## Installation and Setup‚Äã

We need to install `clickhouse-connect` python package.

```bash
pip install clickhouse-connect
```

## Vector Store‚Äã

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/clickhouse).

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Clickhouse, ClickhouseSettings
```</doc_content>

class langchain.vectorstores.clickhouse.Clickhouse(embedding: Embeddings, config: Optional[ClickhouseSettings] = None, **kwargs: Any)[source]¬∂
ClickHouse VectorSearch vector store.
You need a clickhouse-connect python package, and a valid account
to connect to ClickHouse.
ClickHouse can not only search with simple vector indexes,
it also supports complex query with multiple conditions,
constraints and even sub-queries.

[Skip to main content](#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)# Runhouse

This page covers how to use the [Runhouse](https://github.com/run-house/runhouse) ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into three parts: installation and setup, LLMs, and Embeddings.

## Installation and Setup‚Äã

- Install the Python SDK with `pip install runhouse`

- If you'd like to use on-demand cluster, check your cloud credentials with `sky check`

## Self-hosted LLMs‚Äã

For a basic self-hosted LLM, you can use the `SelfHostedHuggingFaceLLM` class. For more
custom LLMs, you can use the `SelfHostedPipeline` parent class.

```python
from langchain.llms import SelfHostedPipeline, SelfHostedHuggingFaceLLM
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of the Self-hosted LLMs, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/llms/runhouse)

## Self-hosted Embeddings‚Äã

There are several ways to use self-hosted embeddings with LangChain via Runhouse.</doc_content>

The [Runhouse](https://github.com/run-house/runhouse) allows remote compute and data across environments and users. See the [Runhouse docs](https://runhouse-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/).

This example goes over how to use LangChain and [Runhouse](https://github.com/run-house/runhouse) to interact with models hosted on your own GPU, or on-demand GPUs on AWS, GCP, AWS, or Lambda.</doc_content>

Answer: RunHouse is an ecosystem that allows remote compute and data across environments and users, whereas ClickHouse is a fast and resource-efficient open-source database for real-time apps and analytics with full SQL support. They are two different systems with distinct purposes, and LangChain provides integrations with both of them.
