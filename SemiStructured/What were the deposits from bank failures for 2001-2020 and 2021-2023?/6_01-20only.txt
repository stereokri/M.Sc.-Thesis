Bank Failures, 2021-2023. There were no bank failures in 
2021 or 2022. The two bank failures in 2023—SVB and 
SB—collectively held $319 billion in assets and $264 
billion in deposits (see Table 1). The second-largest bank 
failure in U.S. history was SVB, with $209 billion in assets 
and $175 billion in deposits. SB had $110 billion in assets 
and $89 billion in deposits when it failed. The number of 
problem banks as of Q3 2022 was 39, with combined assets 
of $47.5 billion.  
Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). Deposit insurance 
guarantees repayments of deposits at a bank up to the 
statutory insured limit, $250,000. It is intended to protect 
depositors, prevent bank runs, and reduce the risk of 
systemic failure of the banking system. Banks pay deposit</doc_content>

<doc_content>based on Q3 2022 information, it reported 39 problem 
banks with collective assets of $47.5 billion. Based on the 
amount of assets reported at the end of September 2022, 
bank regulators did not consider SVB and SB problem 
banks. This was also the case when Washington Mutual 
Bank failed in September 2008. 
Arguably, the issues surrounding the bank failures in 2023 
evolved quickly, but some of the underlying issues existed 
even five years ago. In a report published by the Financial 
Stability Oversight Council in 2018, among medium-size 
banks, SVB had the highest percentage of uninsured 
deposits at nearly 80%. It had nearly $44 billion in total 
deposits in March 2018, and the deposits grew to $175 
billion by March 2023—nearly a fourfold increase.  
As a consequence of these recent failures, questions have 
arisen surrounding the large bank regulatory regime created 
in the first two decades of this century and how they should 
be tailored to address the systemic risks posed by medium-</doc_content>

bank, and other assets while the bank remains solvent. 
When a bank’s capital situation deteriorates such that it 
fails to meet minimum regulatory standards, the bank’s 
primary federal regulator is required to take prompt 
corrective action (PCA). Regulators typically issue a PCA 
letter advising the bank on specific actions it must take to 
restore itself to financial health. When a critically 
undercapitalized bank fails to meet PCA requirements, its 
chartering agency will typically close the bank. By law, the 
FDIC is appointed receiver. 
Bank Failures, 2001-2020. There were 561 bank failures 
between 2001 and 2020 (see Table 1). The failed banks 
collectively held $721 billion in assets and $522 billion in 
deposits. In nominal dollars, the largest bank failure in U.S. 
history was Washington Mutual Bank in 2008 with $307 
billion in assets and $188 billion in deposits. Most

<doc_content>history was Washington Mutual Bank in 2008 with $307 
billion in assets and $188 billion in deposits. Most 
depository institutions that failed were relatively small 
banks, with a large majority having less than $1 billion in 
deposits. Not all banks fail after becoming distressed—the 
number of problem banks identified by the bank regulators 
reached a high of 884, representing $390 billion in assets at 
the end of 2010.  
In response to the bank failures between 2007 and 2010 and 
the related financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and 
Consumer Protection Act in 2010 (P.L. 111-203) was 
enacted to reform the financial regulatory system. The act 
permanently increased the deposit insurance limit from 
$100,000 to $250,000. Subsequently, in 2018, the 
Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer 
Protection Act (P.L. 115-174) was enacted, providing banks 
regulatory relief from certain requirements.
