As Table 2 shows, underreported income is by far the 
largest source of the federal tax gap, accounting for 80% of 
the gross tax gap in 2011-2013 and 2020-2021. The three 
components’ shares shifted little between the two periods. 
The main source of the gross tax gap is individual income 
underreporting. In 2021, it accounted for 73% of total 
underreported income and 58% of the gross tax gap.

a. The percentage of federal taxes owed in a year that were not 
paid on time, after IRS enforcement actions and late taxpayer 
payments. 
Sources of the Federal Tax Gap 
The federal tax gap has three main sources: (1) 
understatement of tax liability through unreported income 
or overstated deductions, credits, and other income 
adjustments; (2) failure to pay taxes owed on time; and (3) 
failure to file a return on time.

<doc_content>underreported income and 58% of the gross tax gap. 
Unreported individual business and nonbusiness income 
made up 74% of total individual underreported income and 
over 42% of the gross tax gap. Much of individual business 
income is subject to little or no withholding and 
information reporting, making it more difficult for the IRS 
to detect than wage, interest, and dividend income. 
According to IRS estimates, in 2014 to 2016, the net 
misreporting percentage for wages and salaries was 1%, but 
it was 15% for partnership and S corporation income and 
55% for sole proprietor income.  
Contributing Factors 
IRS Resources 
The sizes of the IRS budget and staff, especially for 
enforcement activities and taxpayer services, affect the tax 
gap through their impact on taxpayer compliance. 
Substantial decreases in those resources since FY2010 have 
resulted in sharp declines in audit rates for high-income 
individuals, partnerships, and large corporations. 
Between FY2010 and FY2022, the IRS budget (measured 
as total obligations in 2022 dollars) declined 18%. The</doc_content>

Between FY2010 and FY2022, the IRS budget (measured 
as total obligations in 2022 dollars) declined 18%. The 
IRS’s full-time equivalent workforce declined 17% in the 
same period, with higher rates of decline among employees 
involved in examinations and collections (58%) and 
prefiling assistance (28%).  
Income Visibility 
Another force is the IRS’s ability to track down taxable 
income. Income is easiest to track when it is subject to 
information reporting by third parties. Compliance is even 
greater when income is also subject to employer 
withholding, as is the case for wages and salaries. 
According to IRS estimates, underreported tax liability in 
2021 was $167 billion for income subject to little or no 
information reporting (e.g., farm income, sole proprietor 
income, rents, and royalties), but only $9 billion for income 
subject to substantial reporting and withholding.
