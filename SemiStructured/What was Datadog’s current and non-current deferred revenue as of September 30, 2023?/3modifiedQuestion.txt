SeptemberÂ 30, 2023 and other filings and reports that we may file from time to time with the SEC. Moreover, 
we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is 
not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our 
business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ 
materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, 
uncertainties and assumptions, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, 
achievements, or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will occur. Forward-
looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release. We

Based on the provided context, there is no "deferred revenue" in Datadog's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets report. The report only provides information about assets, including current and non-current assets such as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, deferred contract costs, prepaid expenses, property and equipment, operating lease assets, goodwill, and intangible assets.

Therefore, it is not possible to determine Datadog's current and non-current deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023.
