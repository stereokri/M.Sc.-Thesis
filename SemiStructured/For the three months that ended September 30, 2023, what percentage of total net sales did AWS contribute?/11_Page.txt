According to the table, for the three months that ended September 30, 2023, AWS segment's net sales were $23,059. The total net sales can be calculated by adding up the net sales of North America and International segments: $32,137 + $29,123 = $61,260.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of total net sales that AWS contributed:

($23,059 ÷ $61,260) × 100% ≈ 37.7%

So, for the three months that ended September 30, 2023, AWS contributed approximately 37.7% of total net sales.
