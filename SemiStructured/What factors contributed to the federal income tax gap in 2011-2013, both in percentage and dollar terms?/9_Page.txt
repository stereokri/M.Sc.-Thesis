a. The percentage of federal taxes owed in a year that were not 
paid on time, after IRS enforcement actions and late taxpayer 
payments. 
Sources of the Federal Tax Gap 
The federal tax gap has three main sources: (1) 
understatement of tax liability through unreported income 
or overstated deductions, credits, and other income 
adjustments; (2) failure to pay taxes owed on time; and (3) 
failure to file a return on time.

As Table 2 shows, underreported income is by far the 
largest source of the federal tax gap, accounting for 80% of 
the gross tax gap in 2011-2013 and 2020-2021. The three 
components’ shares shifted little between the two periods. 
The main source of the gross tax gap is individual income 
underreporting. In 2021, it accounted for 73% of total 
underreported income and 58% of the gross tax gap. 
Unreported individual business and nonbusiness income 
made up 74% of total individual underreported income and 
over 42% of the gross tax gap. Much of individual business 
income is subject to little or no withholding and 
information reporting, making it more difficult for the IRS 
to detect than wage, interest, and dividend income. 
According to IRS estimates, in 2014 to 2016, the net 
misreporting percentage for wages and salaries was 1%, but 
it was 15% for partnership and S corporation income and 
55% for sole proprietor income.  
Contributing Factors 
IRS Resources 
The sizes of the IRS budget and staff, especially for 
enforcement activities and taxpayer services, affect the tax 
gap through their impact on taxpayer compliance. 
Substantial decreases in those resources since FY2010 have 
resulted in sharp declines in audit rates for high-income 
individuals, partnerships, and large corporations. 
Between FY2010 and FY2022, the IRS budget (measured 
as total obligations in 2022 dollars) declined 18%. The 
IRS’s full-time equivalent workforce declined 17% in the 
same period, with higher rates of decline among employees 
involved in examinations and collections (58%) and 
prefiling assistance (28%).  
Income Visibility 
Another force is the IRS’s ability to track down taxable 
income. Income is easiest to track when it is subject to 
information reporting by third parties. Compliance is even 
greater when income is also subject to employer 
withholding, as is the case for wages and salaries. 
According to IRS estimates, underreported tax liability in 
2021 was $167 billion for income subject to little or no 
information reporting (e.g., farm income, sole proprietor 
income, rents, and royalties), but only $9 billion for income 
subject to substantial reporting and withholding.  
Tax Code Complexity 
The federal tax gap is also thought to be influenced by the 
federal tax code’s complexity. Frequent changes in tax 
provisions complicate tax filing for many individuals, 
leading to unintended errors that add to the tax gap. Tax 
code complexity also creates opportunities for taxpayers 
who can afford to hire tax professionals to reduce their tax 
liability through questionable interpretations of the code. 
Inflation Reduction Act 
The 117th Congress passed legislation intended, in part, to 
reduce the federal tax gap. Under the law, commonly 
known as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA; P.L. 117-169), 
the IRS was to receive nearly $79 billion in mandatory 
funding through the end of FY2031, in addition to its 
annual appropriations. (That amount was later reduced by 
$21 billion between FY2023 and FY2025 by the Fiscal 
Responsibility Act of 2023 [P.L. 118-5].) The IRA 
specified that $3 billion was to improve taxpayer services, 
$46 billion to expand enforcement actions, $25 billion to 
maintain and upgrade the IRS’s information systems, and 
$5 billion to accelerate the IRS’s efforts to modernize its 
information technology infrastructure.  
As enacted, the IRA has the potential to boost revenue 
collection. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated 
that the IRA funding would increase revenue by $180 
billion between FY2022 and FY2031.  
Critics say that too much of the IRA funding for the IRS is 
targeted at enforcement and not enough at taxpayer services 
and information systems modernization. This emphasis on 
enforcement raises at least two perennial issues. One is the 
return on investment (ROI) from new enforcement actions 
tied to IRA. Such actions vary in their cost-effectiveness. 
Some argue that the IRS should invest its IRA enforcement 
funds in actions with the highest ROI.  
The other issue is the impact of increased investment in tax 
enforcement on taxpayer rights. Some are concerned that 
substantial increases in enforcement may lead the IRS to 
devote less attention to the protection of taxpayer rights. As 
the National Taxpayer Advocate recently noted, the IRS’s 
added investments in enforcement should avoid increasing 
taxpayer filing burdens, prioritize the protection of taxpayer 
rights, and heed the concerns of compliant taxpayers.

Federal Tax Gap: Size, Contributing Factors, and the Debate 
over Reducing It
Nature of the Federal Tax Gap 
The federal tax gap is a measure of overall taxpayer 
noncompliance in a specified period. The Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) provides two estimates of the federal tax gap: 
a gross measure and a net measure. The gross tax gap is the 
difference between the total amount of federal individual 
and corporate income, employment, and estate and gift 
taxes owed in a year and the total amount of those taxes 
paid voluntarily on time. The net tax gap is the difference 
between all taxes owed and taxes paid after accounting for 
late taxpayer payments and taxes collected through IRS 
enforcement actions. This estimate does not consider the 
deterrent effects of IRS enforcement on taxpayer 
noncompliance. 
The federal tax gap has three main components: failure to 
file, income underreporting, and tax underpayment. 
There are several reasons why the federal tax gap may be a 
concern for policymakers. The gap represents uncollected 
revenue that the federal government could use for many 
purposes, including reducing the budget deficit. The gap 
imposes costs on compliant taxpayers that are not borne 
equally by noncompliant taxpayers (e.g., higher taxes in the 
future, cutbacks in beneficial government programs, and 
larger interest payments on federal debt to finance budget 
deficits). Sustained growth in the tax gap may undermine 
public confidence in the fairness and integrity of the federal 
tax system, encouraging more noncompliance. 
Estimating the Federal Tax Gap 
The IRS has been estimating the size and composition of 
the tax gap since 1979. Until 1989, the estimates for tax 
compliance were based on data obtained through the 
Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program (TCMP). The 
data came from comprehensive in-person audits by IRS 
examination officers of random samples of individual, 
corporate, and employment tax returns. Many audited 
taxpayers found them burdensome, as they were required to 
provide supporting documents for every tax return line 
item. The IRS suspended use of the TCMP in 1988. 
In 2000, the IRS adopted a different method of collecting 
individual tax compliance data known as the National 
Research Program (NRP), which is still in use today. To 
estimate compliance, the NRP uses a random stratified 
sample of about 13,000 taxpayers deemed representative of 
the entire filing population to select tax returns for audit. 
Random sampling provides information on both compliant 
taxpayers and noncompliant taxpayers who otherwise might 
be difficult to identify using the IRS’s income detection 
tools. To estimate other components of the tax gap (e.g., 
corporate income and employment taxes), the IRS relies on 
a variety of data sources and empirical methods.  
There are some deficiencies with the IRS’s estimation 
methods that have raised some questions about the accuracy 
of its tax gap estimates. In a March 2023 report, the 
Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found 
that the IRS does not include estimates of all sources of 
taxpayer noncompliance in its tax gap estimates. For 
instance, in estimating income underreporting, the IRS 
excludes excise taxes; estate and trust taxes; unrelated 
business income taxes; some employment taxes; subchapter 
S corporate income; and individual income taxes for U.S. 
taxpayers with foreign addresses. It is unclear how much 
larger the income underreporting estimate would be if those 
sources were included. 
Size of the Tax Gap 
The most recent tax gap estimate by the IRS covers tax 
years 2020 and 2021. According to the report, the average 
gross gap in that period was a projected $688 billion, which 
yielded a taxpayer net compliance rate of 86.2% for all 
federal taxes owed. Late payments and IRS enforcement 
actions resulted in a projected average net gap of $582 
billion.  
As Table 1 shows, between 2001 and 2021, the net federal 
tax gap (2021 dollars) reached its lowest level in 2001 
($444 billion) and its highest level in 2021 ($582 billion), 
with some ups and downs in between. The net taxpayer 
noncompliance rate was the same in 2001 and 2021, with 
the highest rate in 2008-2010 and the lowest rate in 2014-
2016.

<doc_content>Reconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage 
Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues (in millions, except 
percentages; unaudited):
We provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues (“constant currency revenues”) and non-GAAP percentage change 
in constant currency revenues (“percentage change in constant currency revenues”), because they facilitate the 
comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (“FX 
Effect”) as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level, as they are not indicative of our 
core operating results.
Non-GAAP constant currency revenues is defined as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate 
movements and hedging activities and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange 
rates and excluding any hedging effect recognized in the current period. We calculate the percentage change in 
constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, 
excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.
