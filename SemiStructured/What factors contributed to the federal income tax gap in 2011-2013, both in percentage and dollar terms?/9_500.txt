a. The percentage of federal taxes owed in a year that were not 
paid on time, after IRS enforcement actions and late taxpayer 
payments. 
Sources of the Federal Tax Gap 
The federal tax gap has three main sources: (1) 
understatement of tax liability through unreported income 
or overstated deductions, credits, and other income 
adjustments; (2) failure to pay taxes owed on time; and (3) 
failure to file a return on time.

As Table 2 shows, underreported income is by far the 
largest source of the federal tax gap, accounting for 80% of 
the gross tax gap in 2011-2013 and 2020-2021. The three 
components’ shares shifted little between the two periods. 
The main source of the gross tax gap is individual income 
underreporting. In 2021, it accounted for 73% of total 
underreported income and 58% of the gross tax gap. 
Unreported individual business and nonbusiness income 
made up 74% of total individual underreported income and 
over 42% of the gross tax gap. Much of individual business 
income is subject to little or no withholding and 
information reporting, making it more difficult for the IRS 
to detect than wage, interest, and dividend income.</doc_content>

Federal Tax Gap: Size, Contributing Factors, and the Debate 
over Reducing It
Nature of the Federal Tax Gap 
The federal tax gap is a measure of overall taxpayer 
noncompliance in a specified period. The Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) provides two estimates of the federal tax gap: 
a gross measure and a net measure. The gross tax gap is the 
difference between the total amount of federal individual 
and corporate income, employment, and estate and gift 
taxes owed in a year and the total amount of those taxes 
paid voluntarily on time. The net tax gap is the difference 
between all taxes owed and taxes paid after accounting for 
late taxpayer payments and taxes collected through IRS 
enforcement actions. This estimate does not consider the 
deterrent effects of IRS enforcement on taxpayer 
noncompliance. 
The federal tax gap has three main components: failure to 
file, income underreporting, and tax underpayment. 
There are several reasons why the federal tax gap may be a 
concern for policymakers. The gap represents uncollected 
revenue that the federal government could use for many 
purposes, including reducing the budget deficit. The gap 
imposes costs on compliant taxpayers that are not borne 
equally by noncompliant taxpayers (e.g., higher taxes in the 
future, cutbacks in beneficial government programs, and 
larger interest payments on federal debt to finance budget 
deficits). Sustained growth in the tax gap may undermine 
public confidence in the fairness and integrity of the federal 
tax system, encouraging more noncompliance. 
Estimating the Federal Tax Gap 
The IRS has been estimating the size and composition of 
the tax gap since 1979. Until 1989, the estimates for tax 
compliance were based on data obtained through the 
Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program (TCMP). The 
data came from comprehensive in-person audits by IRS 
examination officers of random samples of individual, 
corporate, and employment tax returns. Many audited 
taxpayers found them burdensome, as they were required to 
provide supporting documents for every tax return line</doc_content>

<doc_content>federal taxes owed. Late payments and IRS enforcement 
actions resulted in a projected average net gap of $582 
billion.  
As Table 1 shows, between 2001 and 2021, the net federal 
tax gap (2021 dollars) reached its lowest level in 2001 
($444 billion) and its highest level in 2021 ($582 billion), 
with some ups and downs in between. The net taxpayer 
noncompliance rate was the same in 2001 and 2021, with 
the highest rate in 2008-2010 and the lowest rate in 2014-
2016.

<doc_content>income is subject to little or no withholding and 
information reporting, making it more difficult for the IRS 
to detect than wage, interest, and dividend income. 
According to IRS estimates, in 2014 to 2016, the net 
misreporting percentage for wages and salaries was 1%, but 
it was 15% for partnership and S corporation income and 
55% for sole proprietor income.  
Contributing Factors 
IRS Resources 
The sizes of the IRS budget and staff, especially for 
enforcement activities and taxpayer services, affect the tax 
gap through their impact on taxpayer compliance. 
Substantial decreases in those resources since FY2010 have 
resulted in sharp declines in audit rates for high-income 
individuals, partnerships, and large corporations. 
Between FY2010 and FY2022, the IRS budget (measured 
as total obligations in 2022 dollars) declined 18%. The 
IRS’s full-time equivalent workforce declined 17% in the 
same period, with higher rates of decline among employees 
involved in examinations and collections (58%) and 
prefiling assistance (28%).  
Income Visibility 
Another force is the IRS’s ability to track down taxable 
income. Income is easiest to track when it is subject to 
information reporting by third parties. Compliance is even 
greater when income is also subject to employer 
withholding, as is the case for wages and salaries. 
According to IRS estimates, underreported tax liability in 
2021 was $167 billion for income subject to little or no 
information reporting (e.g., farm income, sole proprietor 
income, rents, and royalties), but only $9 billion for income 
subject to substantial reporting and withholding.  
Tax Code Complexity 
The federal tax gap is also thought to be influenced by the 
federal tax code’s complexity. Frequent changes in tax 
provisions complicate tax filing for many individuals, 
leading to unintended errors that add to the tax gap. Tax 
code complexity also creates opportunities for taxpayers 
who can afford to hire tax professionals to reduce their tax 
liability through questionable interpretations of the code.

According to Table 2, the components of the Gross Federal Tax Gap for 2011-2013 are:

* Nonfiling: $37 billion (8%)
* Underreported Income: $349 billion (80%)
* Underpayment of tax: $52 billion (12%)

So, underreported income was the largest contributor to the federal income tax gap in 2011-2013, accounting for 80% of the gross tax gap.
