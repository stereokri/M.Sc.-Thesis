a. The percentage of federal taxes owed in a year that were not 
paid on time, after IRS enforcement actions and late taxpayer 
payments. 
Sources of the Federal Tax Gap 
The federal tax gap has three main sources: (1) 
understatement of tax liability through unreported income 
or overstated deductions, credits, and other income 
adjustments; (2) failure to pay taxes owed on time; and (3) 
failure to file a return on time.

As Table 2 shows, underreported income is by far the 
largest source of the federal tax gap, accounting for 80% of 
the gross tax gap in 2011-2013 and 2020-2021. The three 
componentsâ€™ shares shifted little between the two periods. 
The main source of the gross tax gap is individual income 
underreporting. In 2021, it accounted for 73% of total 
underreported income and 58% of the gross tax gap. 
Unreported individual business and nonbusiness income 
made up 74% of total individual underreported income and</doc_content>

Federal Tax Gap: Size, Contributing Factors, and the Debate 
over Reducing It
Nature of the Federal Tax Gap 
The federal tax gap is a measure of overall taxpayer 
noncompliance in a specified period. The Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) provides two estimates of the federal tax gap: 
a gross measure and a net measure. The gross tax gap is the 
difference between the total amount of federal individual 
and corporate income, employment, and estate and gift 
taxes owed in a year and the total amount of those taxes 
paid voluntarily on time. The net tax gap is the difference 
between all taxes owed and taxes paid after accounting for 
late taxpayer payments and taxes collected through IRS 
enforcement actions. This estimate does not consider the 
deterrent effects of IRS enforcement on taxpayer 
noncompliance. 
The federal tax gap has three main components: failure to 
file, income underreporting, and tax underpayment.

According to Table 2, the components of the Gross Federal Tax Gap for 2011-2013 are:

* Nonfiling: $37 (8%)
* Underreported Income: $349 (80%)
* Underpayment of tax: $52 (12%)

So, in percentage terms, underreported income contributed 80% to the federal income tax gap, nonfiling contributed 8%, and underpayment of tax contributed 12%.

In dollar terms, underreported income contributed $349 billion, nonfiling contributed $37 billion, and underpayment of tax contributed $52 billion.
