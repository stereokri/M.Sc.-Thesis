Description: Building applications with language models involves many moving parts. One of the most critical components is ensuring that the outcomes produced by your models are reliable and useful across a broad array of inputs, and that they work well with your application's other software components. Ensuring reliability usually boils down to some combination of application design, testing & evaluation, and runtime checks.

Description: Amazon Textract is a machine learning (ML) service that automatically extracts text, handwriting, and data from scanned documents. It goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to identify, understand, and extract data from forms and tables. Today, many companies manually extract data from scanned documents such as PDFs, images, tables, and forms, or through simple OCR software that requires manual configuration (which often must be updated when the form changes). To overcome these manual and expensive processes, Textract uses ML to read and process any type of document, accurately extracting text, handwriting, tables, and other data with no manual effort. You can quickly automate document processing and act on the information extracted, whether you’re automating loans processing or extracting information from invoices and receipts. Textract can extract the data in minutes instead of hours or days.

Description: Certain OpenAI models (like gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613) have been fine-tuned to detect when a function should be called and respond with the inputs that should be passed to the function. In an API call, you can describe functions and have the model intelligently choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call those functions. The goal of the OpenAI Function APIs is to more reliably return valid and useful function calls than a generic text completion or chat API.

Description: You can add tags to your callbacks by passing a tags argument to the call()/run()/apply() methods. This is useful for filtering your logs, e.g. if you want to log all requests made to a specific LLMChain, you can add a tag, and then filter your logs by that tag. You can pass tags to both constructor and request callbacks, see the examples above for details. These tags are then passed to the tags argument of the "start" callback methods, ie. onllmstart, onchatmodelstart, onchainstart, ontool_start.

Description: The map reduce documents chain first applies an LLM chain to each document individually (the Map step), treating the chain output as a new document. It then passes all the new documents to a separate combine documents chain to get a single output (the Reduce step). It can optionally first compress, or collapse, the mapped documents to make sure that they fit in the combine documents chain (which will often pass them to an LLM). This compression step is performed recursively if necessary.

Description: This text splitter is the recommended one for generic text. It is parameterized by a list of characters. It tries to split on them in order until the chunks are small enough. The default list is ["\n\n", "\n", " ", ""]. This has the effect of trying to keep all paragraphs (and then sentences, and then words) together as long as possible, as those would generically seem to be the strongest semantically related pieces of text.

Description: Language models have a token limit. You should not exceed the token limit. When you split your text into chunks it is therefore a good idea to count the number of tokens. There are many tokenizers. When you count tokens in your text you should use the same tokenizer as used in the language model.

====== Document nr 874 ======








Description: One challenge with retrieval is that usually you don't know the specific queries your document storage system will face when you ingest data into the system. This means that the information most relevant to a query may be buried in a document with a lot of irrelevant text. Passing that full document through your application can lead to more expensive LLM calls and poorer responses.

Description: It can often be beneficial to store multiple vectors per document. There are multiple use cases where this is beneficial.

Description: Distance-based vector database retrieval embeds (represents) queries in high-dimensional space and finds similar embedded documents based on "distance". But, retrieval may produce different results with subtle changes in query wording or if the embeddings do not capture the semantics of the data well. Prompt engineering / tuning is sometimes done to manually address these problems, but can be tedious.

Description: This notebook covers how to use few-shot examples in chat models. There does not appear to be solid consensus on how best to do few-shot prompting, and the optimal prompt compilation will likely vary by model. Because of this, we provide few-shot prompt templates like the FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate as a flexible starting point, and you can modify or replace them as you see fit.

Description: Graph databases are an excellent choice for applications based on network-like models. To standardize the syntax and semantics of such graphs, the W3C recommends Semantic Web Technologies, cp. Semantic Web. SPARQL serves as a query language analogously to SQL or Cypher for these graphs. This notebook demonstrates the application of LLMs as a natural language interface to a graph database by generating SPARQL.\
